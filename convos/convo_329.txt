STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My daughter is 1 year old and her name is Aurora.
STORYBOT: Aurora is a beautiful name! Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very curious and loves to explore. She's also very honest.
STORYBOT: That's great! Now, every story needs a conflict or problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas for what that could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: Well, one option could be that Aurora is exploring and gets lost. She has to find her way back home with the help of her honesty. What do you think?
CUSTOMER: I like that!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
