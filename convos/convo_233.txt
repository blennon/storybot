STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My main character is my 3 year old granddaughter, Charlotte.
STORYBOT: What a lovely name! And what is Charlotte's personality like?
CUSTOMER: She's a very sweet and curious girl. She's always exploring and trying new things.
STORYBOT: Sounds like Charlotte is quite the adventurous type! Does she have any friends that go on these adventures with her?
CUSTOMER: Yes, she has a few close friends that she likes to play with. But she's also very good at making friends wherever she goes.
STORYBOT: Charlotte sounds like a very social butterfly! Now, every story needs a conflict or problem for the main character to solve. What kind of problem do you think Charlotte would like to solve?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe something involving her friends?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! What about a story where Charlotte and her friends have a disagreement and have to learn to forgive each other?
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect! I think my granddaughter would love a story like that.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
