STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The main character is my 4 year old grandson, Owen. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Got it. Now, what does Owen look like?
CUSTOMER: He's got blonde hair and blue eyes. He's a bit on the small side.
STORYBOT: Excellent. Now, what is Owen's personality like?
CUSTOMER: He's very active and loves to play outside. He can also be quite mischievous at times.
STORYBOT: Sounds like fun! Now, what kind of story are you looking for? A adventure? A comedy? A drama?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I want something that will teach him a lesson, but I'm not sure what kind of story would be best for that.
STORYBOT: Well, how about a story that teaches him the importance of patience?
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
