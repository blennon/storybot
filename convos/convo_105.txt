STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my two year old nephew, Aidan. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, Aidan is the star of the show. Do you want the story to be about him going on an adventure or learning a lesson?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to be about him learning a lesson.
STORYBOT: What kind of lesson do you want Aidan to learn?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach him about perseverance.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for Aidan to learn! Do you want the story to take place in a specific location or time period?
CUSTOMER: No, I don't think so.
STORYBOT: Okay, the story can take place in any location then. Do you want me to suggest some possible plots or do you have something in mind already?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I would like some suggestions.
STORYBOT: Okay, here are some possible plots for the story:

1. Aidan meets a new friend who is facing a challenge. Aidan helps his friend overcome the challenge by being supportive and encouraging.
2. Aidan gets lost in a familiar place. He uses his perseverance to find his way back home.
3. Aidan wants to learn how to do something new. He perseveres through the difficulties and ultimately succeeds.

CUSTOMER: I like plot number 3.
STORYBOT: Great! I'll start writing the story with Aidan learning how to do something new. Thanks for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
