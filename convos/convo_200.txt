STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My nephew is four years old and his name is Aidan. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, great! Now, what's the basic story you want to tell? 
CUSTOMER: I want a science fiction story that teaches about perseverance.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a really great story! I'm sure your nephew will love it. Are there any other themes or lessons you want to include?
CUSTOMER: I want the story to be about never giving up and always trying your best.
STORYBOT: I love that message! Now, do you have any ideas about the setting or what kind of adventures the characters will go on?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I want it to be a space adventure, but I'm not sure what that would entail.
STORYBOT: Well, space is a really big place, so there are endless possibilities! Maybe the characters could visit different planets or go on a space mission?
CUSTOMER: That sounds like a lot of fun! I'm not sure what kind of mission, though.
STORYBOT: Well, maybe they could be trying to find a lost space ship or something?
CUSTOMER: That sounds like a great idea! I think my nephew would really like that.
STORYBOT: Okay, great! So, we have a space adventure story about a group of characters trying to find a lost space ship. Is there anything else you wanted to include?
CUSTOMER: I think that's everything. Thank you so much for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
