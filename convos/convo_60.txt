STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi, Storybot. My nephew is one year old and his name is Luke.
STORYBOT: Okay, so we're writing a story for a one year old boy named Luke. Got it. Now, what else can you tell me about Luke?
CUSTOMER: He's very active and loves to explore. He's also very curious and loves to learn new things.
STORYBOT: Sounds like we have a very adventurous little protagonist on our hands! Now, what about the setting of the story? Where does it take place?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe somewhere like a farm or a zoo.
STORYBOT: Interesting! A farm or a zoo are both great places for a young child to explore. And since Luke is so curious, I think a farm would be the perfect setting for our story. Now, what other elements would you like to include in the story?
CUSTOMER: I would like it to be a educational story that teaches about patience.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a young child to learn! I think we can definitely work that into the story. Now, what genre would you like the story to be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe something like a fable?
STORYBOT: A fable is a great choice! It's a type of story that usually has a moral or lesson to learn. I think a fable would be perfect for our story. Now, what other elements would you like to include in the story?
