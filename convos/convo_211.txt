STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: I want the story to be about my nephew, Rowan. He's 4 years old and a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Rowan is the protagonist of the story. Now, every good story needs an antagonist. Do you have any ideas about who or what that could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I want the story to be educational, so maybe the antagonist could be something that Rowan is struggling with, like self-control.
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! So the story will be about Rowan learning to exercise self-control. Is there anything else you can tell me about the story? For example, what genre do you think it would be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe a lighthearted adventure?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun! Where do you think the story should take place?
CUSTOMER: Rowan lives in a city, so maybe the story could take place there too.
STORYBOT: Great, so the story will take place in a city. Are there any other themes or lessons you want the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I think it would be good for the story to teach kids the importance of self-control.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for kids to learn! I'm sure they'll enjoy the story. Thanks for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
