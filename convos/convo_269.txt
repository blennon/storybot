STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi! I would like the main character to be my three year old nephew, Kai. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Kai is the main character. Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
CUSTOMER: He's very adventurous and loves to explore. He's also very honest.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a fun character! Now, every story needs a good conflict or problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas for what that could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe something about honesty?
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! A story about honesty could teach your nephew a valuable lesson. Do you have any other ideas for the plot?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I'll leave that up to you.
STORYBOT: Okay, I'll come up with a few ideas and you can choose the one you like best. Here are three possibilities:

1. Kai goes on a treasure hunt with his friends and has to decide whether to keep the treasure for himself or share it with his friends.

2. Kai gets lost in the city and has to find his way home. Along the way, he meets some new friends and has to decide whether to help them or not.

3. Kai helps his mom bake a cake for his aunt's birthday. When he accidentally drops the cake, he has to decide whether to tell the truth or lie about what happened.

Which of these three ideas do you like best?
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
