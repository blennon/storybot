STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Theodore is my 1 year old grandson. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, got it. Now, every good story needs a conflict, or a problem for the character to solve. Do you have any ideas about what kind of problem Theodore might face in your story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I was thinking maybe something about being grateful?
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a young child! I'm sure Theodore will have lots of fun learning about gratitude in your story.

Now, every story needs a setting, or a place where the action takes place. Do you have any ideas about where Theodore's story might take place?
CUSTOMER: Maybe at home, or at the park?
STORYBOT: That sounds great! Now, let's talk about the ending of the story. Do you want Theodore to learn something specific by the end of the story?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I want him to learn about being grateful for what he has.
STORYBOT: That's a wonderful lesson for Theodore to learn! I'm sure he'll enjoy the story you write for him.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
