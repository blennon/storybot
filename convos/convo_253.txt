STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my 4 year old nephew, Rowan. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Got it. And what does he look like?
CUSTOMER: He has brown hair and blue eyes. He's a bit small for his age.
STORYBOT: Ok, now onto the antagonist. Who or what will be causing problems for your main character?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I want it to be something that will teach him a lesson about patience.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for kids to learn. For the antagonist, how about we make it a creature that is always in a hurry and never has time for anyone or anything?
CUSTOMER: That sounds good.
STORYBOT: Great! Now let's move onto the setting. Where does the story take place?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe a forest or something.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great setting for an adventure story. Are there any other elements you would like to include in the story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: Well, let's brainstorm a few ideas. Would you like the story to be educational, have a moral lesson, or be just for fun?
CUSTOMER: I would like it to be educational.
STORYBOT: Ok, great. What kind of educational story would you like it to be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: Would you like it to be about animals, history, science, or something else?
CUSTOMER: Science would be good.
STORYBOT: Ok, great. What kind of science would you like it to be about?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: Would you like it to be about space, the human body, the environment, or something else?
CUSTOMER: The environment would be good.
STORYBOT: Ok, great. What kind of environmental story would you like it to be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: Would you like it to be about recycling, conserving energy, reducing pollution, or something else?
CUSTOMER: Reducing pollution would be good.
STORYBOT: Ok, great. What kind of story would you like it to be about reducing pollution?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: Would you like it to be about a character who goes on a journey to save the environment, or a character who learns about the importance of reducing pollution?
CUSTOMER: A character who learns about the importance of reducing pollution would be good.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
