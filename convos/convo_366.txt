STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My nephew is 3 years old and his name is Max. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Max is our protagonist. What does he look like?
CUSTOMER: He's got blonde hair and blue eyes. He's a bit chubby.
STORYBOT: Got it. Now, every good story needs a conflict. What is Max's conflict?
CUSTOMER: Max is always impatient. He wants things right away and gets angry when he doesn't get his way.
STORYBOT: So, Max's conflict is that he's impatient. That's a great conflict for a story. What genre do you think would be best for this story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe an adventure story?
STORYBOT: An adventure story sounds great. Where does Max's adventure take place?
CUSTOMER: In the forest.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Max's adventure takes place in the forest. Are there any other characters in the story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay. We can add other characters later. Are there any themes or lessons you want the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I want the story to teach kids about patience.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for kids to learn. I'm sure they'll enjoy the story. Thanks for your help. I'll get started on the story right away.
