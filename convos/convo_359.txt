STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my 3 year old nephew, Elijah. He's a curious little boy who loves to explore.
STORYBOT: That sounds like fun! Now, every story needs a conflict, or a problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas for what Elijah's conflict could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I want the story to be educational, and teach him a lesson about forgiveness.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a young child! I'm thinking maybe Elijah could make a mistake and then have to learn to forgive himself. What do you think?
CUSTOMER: Yes, that sounds good.
STORYBOT: Great! Now, every story needs a setting, or a place where the action takes place. Do you have any ideas for where Elijah's story could take place?
CUSTOMER: Perhaps his house, or his backyard?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great setting for a young child's story! Now, every story needs a genre, or a type of story. Do you have any ideas for what genre Elijah's story could be?
CUSTOMER: Perhaps a children's book?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! Now, every story needs a theme, or a central idea. Do you have any ideas for what theme Elijah's story could be about?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay! A lot of times, themes can be about things like family, love, or friendship. Do you have any ideas for what Elijah's story could be about?
CUSTOMER: Perhaps Elijah could learn about forgiveness from his family or friends?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! Now, every story needs a lesson, or a moral that the character learns by the end of the story. Do you have any ideas for what lesson Elijah could learn in his story?
CUSTOMER: Perhaps he could learn that it's okay to make mistakes, and that everyone makes them. What do you think?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great lesson for a young child! I think Elijah could learn that it's okay to make mistakes, and that everyone makes them.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
