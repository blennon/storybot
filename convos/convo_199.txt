STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER:

My nephew is one year old and his name is Luke. He's a boy.

STORYBOT:

Great! So we're writing a story for a one-year-old boy named Luke. Do you have any ideas about what kind of story you want? It can be anything from a comedy to an adventure story.

CUSTOMER:

I'm not sure. I just want a story that's appropriate for a one-year-old and that teaches a lesson about honesty.

STORYBOT:

That's a great idea! I have a few suggestions for stories that might fit the bill. One option is a story about a mischievous bunny who gets into trouble for being dishonest. Another option is a story about a little girl who learns the importance of honesty after she tells a lie. Let me know if either of these sound interesting to you or if you have any other ideas.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
