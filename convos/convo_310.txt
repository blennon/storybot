STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi! My name is Ryder and I am 3 years old.
STORYBOT: So, Ryder is your main character?
CUSTOMER: Yes.
STORYBOT: Okay, now that I know a little more about Ryder, can you tell me what kind of story you would like? For example, is this a comedy, drama, or action story?
CUSTOMER: I would like a comedy story.
STORYBOT: Great! A comedy story is always a fun one to write. Now, do you have any ideas about what the story will be about?
CUSTOMER: No, not really.
STORYBOT: That's okay! I'm sure we can come up with something together. Let's see... since this is a comedy, maybe the story could be about Ryder learning a lesson about perseverance. Does that sound good to you?
CUSTOMER: Yes, that sounds perfect!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
