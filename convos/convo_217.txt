STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi Storybot. The protagonist of my story is a 3 year old boy named Rowan. 
STORYBOT: Got it. Is there anything else you can tell me about Rowan?
CUSTOMER: He's a kind boy who likes to help others.
STORYBOT: That's lovely. Now, every great story needs a good conflict. Can you think of anything Rowan might struggle with?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. 
STORYBOT: Well, let's brainstorm a few possibilities. Does Rowan have any siblings or friends that he doesn't get along with?
CUSTOMER: No, he's an only child.
STORYBOT: Okay. Does he have any problems at school?
CUSTOMER: No, he's too young for school.
STORYBOT: Hmmm. Well, sometimes children have problems with sharing or being too messy. Would either of those work for your story?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I think a conflict about sharing would be good.
STORYBOT: Great! Now, every story needs a setting. Where does Rowan live?
CUSTOMER: He lives in a small town in the country.
STORYBOT: Okay. Is there anything else you can tell me about the town?
CUSTOMER: Not really. It's a pretty typical small town.
STORYBOT: All right. Now, what genre do you want your story to be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. 
STORYBOT: Well, let's brainstorm a few possibilities. Would you like it to be a comedy, drama, or action story?
CUSTOMER: A comedy would be good.
STORYBOT: Great! Now, every story needs a moral or lesson. What do you want your story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I want it to teach about kindness.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson. Now, I have everything I need to write an amazing story for your little one. Thank you for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
