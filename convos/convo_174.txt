STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My grandchild is a 2 year old girl named Harper.
STORYBOT: Okay, Harper is a great name! Now, what else can you tell me about your main character?
CUSTOMER: She's very active and loves to explore. She's also very compassionate.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great combination! Now, what kind of story are you looking for? Is there a particular genre or theme you had in mind?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I just want something that's appropriate for a 2 year old and teaches a lesson about compassion.
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! I think a comedy would be perfect for Harper. I also think it would be a great opportunity to teach her a lesson about compassion.
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect! Thank you so much for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
