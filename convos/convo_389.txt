STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My nephew is two years old and his name is Max. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: What does your main character look like?
CUSTOMER: He's got blonde hair and blue eyes. He's a little small for his age.
STORYBOT: What kind of personality does your main character have?
CUSTOMER: Max is a very curious boy. He's always exploring and asking a lot of questions. He can be a little shy at times, but he's also very brave.
STORYBOT: What is the main character's goal in the story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I want it to be something educational, that teaches kids about courage.
STORYBOT: That's a great goal! I'm sure we can come up with a story that does that. Do you have any ideas about what the story might be about?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I was thinking maybe something with a dragon or a knight?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! Let's see if we can come up with a story about a brave knight who has to overcome some challenges with the help of his dragon friend.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
