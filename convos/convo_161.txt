STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER:

I would like the main character to be a 3 year old boy named Luke.

STORYBOT: Okay, so we have a 3 year old boy named Luke as our main character. Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
CUSTOMER:

He is a very active and curious child. He loves to explore and learn new things.

STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun! Now, every great story needs a conflict or problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas for what kind of problem Luke could face in our story?
CUSTOMER:

I'm not sure. I would like it to be a comedy and teach Luke a lesson about patience.

STORYBOT: I see. So you would like our story to be a comedy that teaches Luke a lesson about patience. Do you have any ideas about what kind of situation could create this problem for Luke?

They often get frustrated when they are trying to do something new. Do you have any ideas about what the end of the story could be?
