STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My main character is a 3 year old girl named Quinn.
STORYBOT: Quinn is a great name! Is there anything else you can tell me about her? 
CUSTOMER: She's very adventurous and loves to explore. She's also very stubborn and doesn't like to listen to her parents.
STORYBOT: Sounds like Quinn is quite the handful! I'm sure your daughter will enjoy a story with her in it. Are there any other characters in the story?
CUSTOMER: There is an antagonist, but I'm not sure who or what yet.
STORYBOT: Well, let's brainstorm a few possibilities. Is the antagonist another child that Quinn doesn't get along with? Or maybe an animal that's always getting into trouble?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe an animal, like a dog or a cat.
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! I'm sure your daughter will love a story with a cute animal in it. What kind of setting does the story take place in?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure yet.
STORYBOT: That's okay, we can brainstorm a few possibilities. Does the story take place in Quinn's house? Or maybe in her backyard?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe in her backyard.
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! I'm sure your daughter will love a story that takes place in her own backyard. Are there any specific themes or lessons that you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe a lesson on forgiveness.
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! I'm sure your daughter will love a story that teaches her a lesson on forgiveness. Thank you for all of this information! I have everything I need to write an amazing story for your daughter.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
