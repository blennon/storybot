STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi Storybot. My son is 3 years old and I would like the story to be about a boy.
STORYBOT: Of course! A lot of children's stories have a male protagonist. Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
CUSTOMER: His name is Rowan and I would like the story to be a fantasy.
STORYBOT: A fantasy story is a great choice! They are always so exciting. In a fantasy story, the main character often has to face some sort of challenge or go on a adventure. Is your son the type of child who likes to face challenges?
CUSTOMER: Yes, he is very brave.
STORYBOT: That's great! I think a fantasy story about a brave boy named Rowan would be perfect for him. In this story, Rowan will have to face some challenges, but he will be courageous and overcome them. Along the way, he will learn some important lessons about courage.
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect! Thank you so much for your help, Storybot.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
