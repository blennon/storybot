STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The main character is my one year old grandson, Declan. He's a happy little boy who loves to play.
STORYBOT: What a great main character! Do you have any ideas for the story?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe a comedy?
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! What lessons do you want your story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach Declan about gratitude.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson! Can you think of any other lessons you would like the story to teach?
