STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My granddaughter is one year old and her name is Quinn.
STORYBOT: Quinn is a great name. How about we make her the star of our story?
CUSTOMER: Okay.
STORYBOT: Now that we have our protagonist, every story needs a good conflict. Can you think of any problems Quinn might face in our story?
CUSTOMER: Quinn is very curious and sometimes gets into things she shouldn't. She's also very independent and doesn't like being told what to do.
STORYBOT: I see. So Quinn is a bit of a rebel. I like it.
CUSTOMER: Okay.
STORYBOT: Now let's think about the setting of our story. Where do you think Quinn's adventures should take place?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay. We can brainstorm a few options. Quinn could have adventures in space, on a faraway planet, or even in her own backyard. What do you think?
CUSTOMER: Let's make it a faraway planet.
STORYBOT: Great choice! Now what can you tell me about this planet? Is it inhabited by friendly aliens or hostile creatures?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.

CUSTOMER: Let's make it inhabited by friendly aliens.
STORYBOT: Okay, so our story takes place on a planet full of friendly aliens. That sounds like a lot of fun. Are there any other themes or lessons you would like to include in our story?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach Quinn about compassion.
STORYBOT: I think that's a great lesson for our story. I'm sure Quinn will learn a lot from her adventures.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
