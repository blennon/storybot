STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my 2 year old nephew, Luke. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Luke is the main character. Do you have any ideas about what kind of story you want to write? It can be anything from a comedy to a tragedy.
CUSTOMER: I want it to be a comedy.
STORYBOT: That's great! Comedy is always a fun genre to write. Do you want the story to teach a lesson?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I want it to teach kids about honesty.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for kids to learn! I'm sure we can come up with a great story that will teach them that. Do you have any ideas about what the story should be about?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I just want it to be funny and teach the lesson about honesty.
STORYBOT: Okay, let me see if I can come up with something. I think it would be great if the story was about Luke trying to be honest and getting into comical situations because of it. What do you think?
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
