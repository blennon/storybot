STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My grandson's name is Owen, he's 3 years old and a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, now that we know a little about our protagonist, can you tell me about the world they live in?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking a space station.
STORYBOT: Interesting, a space station. Are there any other planets or galaxies in this story?
CUSTOMER: No, I want it to be a contained story.
STORYBOT: Okay, a contained story. Now, what is the main conflict of the story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay, we can figure it out together. Is there anything you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I want it to teach my grandson about kindness.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson. Can you think of any examples of acts of kindness in the story?
CUSTOMER: Perhaps the protagonist could help someone in need, or stand up to a bully.
STORYBOT: Those are both great examples of kindness. Is there anything else you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: No, I think that's it.
STORYBOT: Okay, so the story will teach about kindness. Are there any other themes you would like to include?
CUSTOMER: No, I think that's it.
STORYBOT: Okay, so the story will teach about kindness and have the theme of family. Does that sound right?
CUSTOMER: Yes, that sounds perfect.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
