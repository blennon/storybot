STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my 3 year old niece, Aurora. She's a female.
STORYBOT: Okay, Aurora is the star of the story. Is there anyone or anything she'll be up against?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay. An antagonist doesn't have to be a person. It could be a problem like not being able to go outside to play because it's raining.
CUSTOMER: I want the story to be educational, so maybe the antagonist could be a feeling like anger or sadness.
STORYBOT: That's an interesting idea. How do you want the story to end?
CUSTOMER: I want it to have a moral lesson, something about forgiveness maybe.
STORYBOT: I think I have enough information to write a great story for Aurora. Thanks for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
