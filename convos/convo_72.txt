STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My son is two years old and his name is Rowan. He's very adventurous.
STORYBOT: Rowan is a great name! And two years old is the perfect age for an adventure story. So, what kind of adventure does Rowan want to go on?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I just want it to be something that will teach him about kindness.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a story. I know just the thing. How about a story where Rowan meets a new friend who needs help? Rowan can show his new friend how kind he is by helping him out.
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect. Thank you so much!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
