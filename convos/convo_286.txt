STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My son is 2 years old and his name is Benjamin. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, so we're writing a story for Benjamin. Is there anything in particular you would like the story to be about?
CUSTOMER: I would like it to be an educational story that teaches about courage.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! Are you thinking of any specific lessons or themes that you would like the story to include?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach Benjamin that it's okay to be scared, but that he can overcome his fears by being brave.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a story! Would you like the story to be set in any particular time or place?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe a story set in medieval times?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great setting for a story about courage! Is there anything else you can think of that you would like the story to include?
CUSTOMER:

I think that's all I can think of for now.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
