STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is two years old and her name is Willow. 
STORYBOT: Okay, so Willow is the main character. Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very adventurous.
STORYBOT: Excellent! An adventure story sounds like perfect for Willow. Now, every adventure story needs a good antagonist. Do you have any ideas for who that could be?
CUSTOMER: Not really. 
STORYBOT: Well, the antagonist could be anyone or anything that gets in Willow's way. It could be an angry dragon, a wicked witch, or even a stormy sea. 
CUSTOMER: I like the idea of a stormy sea. 
STORYBOT: Okay, so the antagonist in our story will be a stormy sea. 
CUSTOMER: I want the story to teach Willow about honesty. 
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a story! I'm sure Willow will love it. 
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure what kind of story I want. 
STORYBOT: That's okay! I can help you figure that out. Do you have any ideas for the setting of the story? 
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe on a pirate ship? 
STORYBOT: Arrrr, that sounds like a great setting for an adventure story! 
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. 
STORYBOT: That's okay! We can keep brainstorming until we find something that you're sure about.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
