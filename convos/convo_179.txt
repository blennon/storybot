STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My main character is my 4 year old grandson, Owen. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, got it. Now, every good story has a conflict or problem for the main character to overcome. Do you have any ideas about what kind of problem Owen might face in his story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I was hoping you could help with that.
STORYBOT: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's see...a comedy story about Owen teaching lessons of gratitude to other kids his age might be fun. What do you think?
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
