STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER:

My nephew is 3 years old and his name is Owen. He's a boy.

STORYBOT:

Owen is a great name! And being 3 years old, he's at a really fun age where he's starting to understand more about the world around him. So, what kind of story are you looking for? Is there a particular genre or lesson you had in mind?

CUSTOMER:

I'm not really sure. I just want something that's funny and will teach him a lesson about forgiveness.

STORYBOT:

That sounds like a great idea! I have a few suggestions for you. First, how about a story about a mischievous little boy who gets into trouble but learns his lesson in the end? Alternatively, we could do a story about a mistake that a character makes and how they learn from it. What do you think?
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
