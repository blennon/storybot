STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist will be a 4 year old girl named Harper.
STORYBOT: Okay, Harper is a great name! Now, what is Harper like? Is she adventurous?
CUSTOMER: Yes, Harper is very adventurous.
STORYBOT: That's great! An adventure story sounds perfect for Harper. I'm thinking of a story where Harper goes on a quest to find a lost puppy. Along the way, she learns the importance of compassion. Would you like me to write this story for Harper?
