STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My nephew is 4 years old and his name is Landon. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, Landon is the perfect age for an epic adventure! 4 year olds are full of energy and love to explore. For his story, should Landon be the hero or the sidekick?
CUSTOMER: The hero.
STORYBOT: Excellent choice! Landon will love being the star of his own story. Now, every hero needs a good nemesis. Do you have any ideas for who that could be?
CUSTOMER: Not really.
STORYBOT: Well, the antagonist could be an evil wizard, an ogre, or even a dragon! What do you think would be the most exciting for Landon?
CUSTOMER: A dragon!
STORYBOT: A dragon it is, then! Now, what kind of setting would you like the story to take place in?
CUSTOMER: A fantasy world.
STORYBOT: Great! A fantasy world is the perfect setting for an adventure story. There are so many possibilities for magical creatures and exciting challenges. Are there any particular themes or lessons you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach my nephew about gratitude.
STORYBOT: That's a wonderful lesson for a 4 year old. I'm sure Landon will enjoy learning about gratitude in a fun and exciting way. Thank you for your help! I think I have everything I need to write a great story for Landon.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
