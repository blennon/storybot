STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER:

My nephew is 3 years old and his name is Owen. He's a boy.

STORYBOT: Interesting! So, do you want the story to be about Owen specifically?
CUSTOMER:

Yes, I want the story to be about Owen and his courage. I want him to learn a lesson about being brave from the story.

STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea for a story! Now, let's talk about setting. Where do you envision the story taking place? 
CUSTOMER:

I'm not sure. Perhaps in a forest?

STORYBOT: That's a great setting for a story about courage! What kind of adventure do you see Owen going on in the forest? 
CUSTOMER:

I'm not sure. Perhaps he could meet some animals in the forest and learn a lesson from them?

STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! I'm sure Owen would love to meet some new animal friends in the forest. Are there any other themes or lessons you would like the story to teach? 
CUSTOMER:

I think courage is the most important lesson. I want Owen to learn that it's okay to be scared, but he should still be brave and face his fears.

STORYBOT: That's a great message for a story! I'm sure Owen will love learning about courage from the story. Thanks for all your input! I'll get started on writing the story right away.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
