STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my two year old nephew, Owen. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, great! Now, what does Owen look like?
CUSTOMER: He has blonde hair and blue eyes. He's a really happy kid, always smiling.
STORYBOT: Sounds like a fun kid! Now, every story needs a conflict, or a problem for the protagonist to solve. Do you have any ideas for what Owen's conflict could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I want it to be something educational, that teaches kids a lesson. Maybe something about being grateful?
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for kids to learn! I'm thinking maybe Owen could be trying to find a way to show his gratitude, but he doesn't know how. He could go on a journey and meet different people, who all teach him different ways to show gratitude. In the end, he could find his own special way to show how grateful he is.
CUSTOMER: I like that! That sounds like a really cute story.
STORYBOT: I think so too! Now, do you have any ideas for the setting of the story? Where does Owen go on his journey?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe he could start in his house, then go outside and explore his neighborhood?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! I'm thinking maybe Owen could meet a neighbor who is always doing kind things for others, and that's how he learns about gratitude. Then he could meet a friend who is always complaining, and he learns that being grateful can make you a happier person. What do you think?
CUSTOMER: I love it! That sounds like a really sweet story.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
