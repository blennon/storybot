STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My daughter is two years old and her name is Piper.
STORYBOT: What a lovely name! And what does Piper like to do?
CUSTOMER: She loves to explore and ask a lot of questions.
STORYBOT: Sounds like Piper is quite the curious one. What else can you tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very determined and always wants to try new things.
STORYBOT: Piper sounds like a great protagonist for a story. Now, every story needs an antagonist. Do you have any ideas for who that could be?
CUSTOMER:

Not really sure. Perhaps an alien or a monster of some sort?
STORYBOT:

An alien or monster could be a great choice for an antagonist in a sci-fi story. Are there any other elements you would like to include in your story?
CUSTOMER:

I would like the story to take place in outer space and I want it to teach my daughter a lesson about patience.
STORYBOT:

Outer space is a great setting for a sci-fi story. I think a lesson about patience would be a great addition to the story. Are you ready to start writing?
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
