STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi! I want the protagonist to be a 1 year old boy named Aidan.
STORYBOT: Okay, now can you give me a few adjectives to describe Aidan?
CUSTOMER: Sure. Aidan is adventurous, curious and playful.
STORYBOT: Excellent! Now, every story needs a conflict or problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas for what Aidan's conflict could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe something about being patient?
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for kids! I think Aidan's conflict could be that he's always rushing into things and never takes the time to think things through. As a result, he often gets himself into trouble. Can you think of any specific examples of this?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I can definitely think of a few examples. One time he ran into the street without looking and almost got hit by a car. Another time he was climbing a tree and fell out and hurt himself.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Aidan's conflict is that he doesn't know how to be patient. He rushes into things without thinking and as a result, he gets hurt. Can you think of a resolution or lesson that Aidan could learn by the end of the story?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I think it would be good for Aidan to learn that it's important to be patient and to think things through before he does them.
STORYBOT: Perfect! So, the story will be about Aidan learning to be patient and to think things through before he does them. Do you have any ideas about what kind of story this could be? Is there a particular genre or setting that you're thinking of?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe a fantasy story set in a magical kingdom?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! In the story, Aidan could go on a quest to find a magical cure for his impatience. Along the way, he would have to overcome various challenges that would teach him the importance of being patient. Do you like this idea?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I think that sounds like a great story!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
