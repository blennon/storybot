CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my one year old nephew, Declan. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Declan is the star of the story. Is there anyone or anything that he'll be up against? An antagonist of some sort?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I want the story to be about him overcoming some kind of challenge.
STORYBOT: Well, in that case, maybe the antagonist could be something like a dragon or a villain.
CUSTOMER: I like that!
STORYBOT: Great! Now, what genre do you think the story should be? A fairy tale? An adventure?
CUSTOMER: An adventure would be great!
STORYBOT: Okay, so Declan will be going on an adventure. Where do you think it should take place?
