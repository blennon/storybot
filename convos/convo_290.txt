STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Zoey is my 4 year old niece. She's a girl.
STORYBOT: Great! Now that I know a little about Zoey, I need to know what kind of adventure she'll be going on. Will it be a space adventure, a pirate adventure, or something else entirely?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. What do you suggest?
STORYBOT: Well, since Zoey is a young girl, I think a space adventure might be a little too advanced for her. I suggest a pirate adventure instead!
CUSTOMER: Okay, a pirate adventure it is!
STORYBOT: Excellent choice! Now, every good pirate adventure needs a villain. Do you have any ideas for who Zoey's villain could be?
CUSTOMER: Not really. Do you have any suggestions?
STORYBOT: How about a mean, greedy pirate captain?
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect!
STORYBOT: Great! Now, every good story needs a lesson. What do you want Zoey to learn from her adventure?
CUSTOMER: I want her to learn about kindness.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson! I'm sure Zoey will learn a lot about kindness from her adventure.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
