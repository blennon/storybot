STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is named Natalie and she's 2 years old.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Natalie is the main character. What else can you tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: Well, she's very adventurous. She loves to explore and is always up for a new challenge.
STORYBOT: It sounds like Natalie would be the perfect protagonist for an adventure story. An adventure story is usually full of excitement, suspense and sometimes even a little bit of danger. Are you looking for a story with any specific themes or lessons?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I would like the story to teach Natalie about courage.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for Natalie to learn. I'm sure she'll be able to handle anything that comes her way with a little bit of courage. Do you have any ideas about what kind of adventure Natalie might go on?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I was hoping you could help me come up with something.
STORYBOT: Sure, I'd be happy to help. One option is that Natalie could go on a treasure hunt. She could have to face a few challenges along the way, but ultimately she would find the treasure and learn about courage. What do you think?
CUSTOMER: That sounds like a great idea. I think Natalie would love it.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
