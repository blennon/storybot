STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My daughter is 4 years old and her name is Aria.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Aria is our protagonist. Do you have any ideas about what kind of story you would like? It can be anything from an adventure to a mystery.
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I just want it to be educational and teach Aria about perseverance.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! I have a few suggestions for you. First, we could have Aria go on a treasure hunt. She could face many challenges along the way, but ultimately find the treasure. This would teach her about perseverance and never giving up. Alternatively, we could have Aria solve a mystery. She could use her detective skills to figure out who stole her toy. This would also teach her about never giving up and being persistent.

CUSTOMER: I like the idea of Aria going on a treasure hunt.
STORYBOT: Great! I'll start writing the story now. Thanks for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
