STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my 4 year old nephew, Rowan. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Got it. Now, every good story has a conflict, or a problem for the main character to face. Can you think of something your nephew might struggle with?
CUSTOMER: I don't know. He's a pretty happy kid.
STORYBOT: That's great! A story about a happy kid can be just as exciting as one with a conflict. Let's brainstorm a few ideas. Would your nephew like a story about going to the moon? Or learning to ride a bike?
CUSTOMER: I think he would like a story about learning to ride a bike.
STORYBOT: Excellent choice! Now, every story needs a setting, or a place where the action takes place. Where would you like your story to take place?
CUSTOMER: In our neighborhood.
STORYBOT: Perfect. Now, every story has a lesson, or a moral at the end. What do you want your story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I want it to teach kids about being kind.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson! I'm sure your nephew will love it.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
