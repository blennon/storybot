STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my 3 year old nephew, Declan. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, got it. Now, every story needs a conflict or problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas about what kind of conflict Declan might face in your story?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking that he could be faced with the task of saving the world from an evil villain.
STORYBOT: Interesting! What kind of villain would he be up against?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe an alien race or something.
STORYBOT: Okay, now we're getting somewhere. Do you have any ideas about what the setting of the story might be?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe outer space or a different planet.
STORYBOT: That sounds like it could be really cool! Are there any specific themes or lessons that you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking that it could teach a lesson about kindness or helping others.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great lesson for a story! I think we have enough information to get started. Thanks for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
