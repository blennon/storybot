STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my 4 year old nephew, Ryder. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, and what does Ryder like to do?
CUSTOMER: He's really into dinosaurs right now.
STORYBOT: That's great! So our story will be about Ryder and his adventures with dinosaurs. And what kind of adventure is he going on?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: Well, let's brainstorm a few ideas. Would he be going on a safari to find dinosaurs? Or going back in time to meet them?
CUSTOMER: I like the idea of him going back in time to meet them.
STORYBOT: Okay, so our story will be about Ryder going back in time to meet dinosaurs. And what does he learn from this adventure?
CUSTOMER: I want the story to be educational and teach him about self-control.
STORYBOT: Okay, so our story will be about Ryder going back in time to meet dinosaurs and learning about self-control.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
