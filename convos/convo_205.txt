STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My grandchild's name is Owen and he's two years old.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Owen is the main character. Are there any other characters in the story?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe an animal of some sort?
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! What kind of animal would you like?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure, maybe a dragon?
STORYBOT: A dragon is a great choice! What else can you tell me about the story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure, I just want it to be a fantasy story and I want it to teach my grandson about gratitude.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great story! I'll get started on it right away. Thank you for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
