STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Harper is a four year old girl.
STORYBOT: Okay, Harper is a great name! Now, what is Harper like? Is she shy or outgoing? What are her interests?
CUSTOMER: She's very outgoing and loves to explore. She's also very brave.
STORYBOT: That sounds like an amazing protagonist! Now, every story needs a good antagonist. Do you have any ideas for who that could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe a dragon?
STORYBOT: A dragon is a great choice! Now, what kind of story do you want to write? Is it a fantasy, adventure, or something else?
CUSTOMER: I want it to be a fantasy.
STORYBOT: Great! Now, what setting do you want your story to take place in?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe a magical kingdom?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great setting! Are there any particular themes or lessons you want your story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I want it to teach about courage.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson! I'm sure Harper will love your story. Thanks for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
