STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My nephew is one year old and his name is Luke.
STORYBOT: Hey Luke! Sounds like you're going to have a great adventure. So what kind of adventure are you looking for?
CUSTOMER: I want a story that teaches about gratitude.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for kids! How about we make it an adventure story where Luke has to save the day?
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
