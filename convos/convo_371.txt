STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my two year old granddaughter, Aurora.
STORYBOT: Okay, Aurora is the protagonist. What is the story about?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I want it to be a sci-fi story and teach about gratitude.
STORYBOT: A sci-fi story about gratitude? That sounds like an interesting concept. Do you have any ideas about what the story might be about?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I just know that I want it to be a sci-fi story and teach about gratitude.
STORYBOT: Well, let's brainstorm some ideas. Perhaps the story could be about Aurora discovering a secret laboratory and learning about the importance of being grateful for what she has.
CUSTOMER: That sounds like a good idea. I like it.
STORYBOT: Great! I'll get started on the story right away.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
