STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is two years old and I would like the story to be about a little girl.
STORYBOT: Okay, so the protagonist of your story will be a little girl. Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very adventurous and loves to explore. She's also very compassionate and always looks out for others.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great protagonist! Now, what about the story's setting? Where will it take place?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe a fantasy world?
STORYBOT: A fantasy world is a great setting for a story like this! What kind of adventures do you think your little girl will have in this world?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure, that's why I need your help.
STORYBOT: Okay, let me see if I can come up with some ideas. In a fantasy world, your little girl could go on quests to save the kingdom, or go on a journey to find a magical treasure. What do you think?
CUSTOMER: I like the idea of her going on a quest to save the kingdom.
STORYBOT: Okay, so your little girl will go on a quest to save the kingdom. Are there any other themes or lessons you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I think it would be nice if the story taught about compassion.
STORYBOT: Okay, so the story will teach about compassion. Do you have any other ideas that you would like to share?
CUSTOMER: That's all for now, thank you for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
