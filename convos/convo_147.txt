STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: I want the protagonist to be a 3 year old boy named Declan.
STORYBOT: Okay, now let's move on to the antagonist. Do you want your story to be about a battle between good and evil, or just some light-hearted mischief?
CUSTOMER: I want the story to be light-hearted and teach a lesson about compassion.
STORYBOT: Sounds like you might be interested in a comedy. In that case, we'll need a setting. Where would you like your story to take place?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay. We can brainstorm a few options. Would you like your story to take place in a city, the country, or outer space?
CUSTOMER: The country.
STORYBOT: Okay, now let's think about themes. Do you want your story to be about family, friendship, or something else entirely?
CUSTOMER: Friendship.
STORYBOT: Great. Now, do you want your story to have a moral lesson? If so, what would you like that lesson to be?
CUSTOMER: I want the story to teach a lesson about compassion.
