STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER:

My niece is Natalie and she's two years old. I'd like the story to be a comedy that teaches about compassion.
STORYBOT:

Great, so we're looking for a comedic story with a female protagonist that teaches about compassion. Do you have any ideas about what the story could be about?
CUSTOMER:

Not really. I just know that I want it to be funny and for Natalie to learn something about compassion from it.
STORYBOT:

Well, one option could be a story about a little girl who's trying to be nice to her parents, but everything she does seems to make them mad. In the end, she learns that sometimes it's the thought that counts, and her parents are just happy she's trying.
CUSTOMER:

I like that! It's perfect for Natalie.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
