STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My granddaughter is one years old and her name is Paige.
STORYBOT: Paige is a great name! And what do you know about her?
CUSTOMER: Not much, she's still a baby.
STORYBOT: Okay, so we'll need to come up with a story that is appropriate for a one year old. Can you tell me what genre you're thinking of?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking a fantasy story.
STORYBOT: A fantasy story sounds great! What kind of lessons do you want the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I want the story to teach about forgiveness.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a story! Can you tell me more about the setting of the story?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe something like a magical kingdom.
STORYBOT: A magical kingdom sounds like a great setting for a fantasy story! Are there any other themes that you would like the story to include?
CUSTOMER: I don't know, something else that would be appropriate for a one year old.
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! I'll see what I can come up with. Thank you for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
