CUSTOMER:

My nephew is named Oliver and he's just turned one. He's a very adventurous little boy, always exploring and getting into mischief. I want a story that will teach him about gratitude and the importance of being thankful for what he has.

STORYBOT:

That sounds like a great lesson for Oliver! I'm sure he would love an adventure story. Do you have any ideas about what kind of adventure he could go on?
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
