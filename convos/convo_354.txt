STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is two years old and her name is Sofia.
STORYBOT: What a lovely name! Is there anything else you can tell me about Sofia?
CUSTOMER: Sofia is very adventurous, and loves learning new things.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun! So, your story will be an adventure story. That's perfect for a little girl like Sofia.

STORYBOT: Now that we have the main character figured out, let's move on to the antagonist. Do you have any ideas for who or what that could be?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe a hungry shark, or a mean clown.
STORYBOT: Hmm, those are both pretty good options. Let me see if I can come up with something else.

STORYBOT: What if the antagonist was a big, friendly dog that was just misunderstood?
CUSTOMER: I like that!
STORYBOT: Great! So, the antagonist in your story will be a big, friendly dog that is just misunderstood.

STORYBOT: Now, let's move on to the setting. Where do you want your story to take place?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe the beach, or a carnival.

STORYBOT: How about a pirate ship?
CUSTOMER: I love that!
STORYBOT: Great! So, the setting in your story will be a pirate ship.

STORYBOT: Now, let's move on to the themes and lessons you want your story to teach. Do you have any ideas for that?
