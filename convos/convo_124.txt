STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my two year old granddaughter, Harper. 
STORYBOT: Okay, so Harper is the main character. Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: Harper is a very active and curious child. She loves to explore and is always getting into mischief.
STORYBOT: Sounds like Harper will be a fun character to write about. Now, every good story needs a conflict or problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas about what kind of problem Harper could face in her story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I want the story to be about forgiveness, but I'm not sure what kind of problem would fit that theme.
STORYBOT: That's a great theme for a story. Let me see if I can come up with a few ideas. Would a story about Harper losing her toy and having to ask her friend to forgive her be something you're interested in?
CUSTOMER: That could work. I also like the idea of Harper accidentally breaking something and having to ask for forgiveness.
STORYBOT: Those are both great ideas. Let me see if I can come up with a few more. Would a story about Harper being scared to go to bed because she's afraid of the dark be something you're interested in?
CUSTOMER: That sounds like a great idea! I think Harper would be a brave character in that story.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
