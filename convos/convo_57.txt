STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my two year old grandson, Owen. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, got it. Now, every story needs a good conflict. Should Owen's adventure be filled with excitement or suspense?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure, what do you think?
STORYBOT: Well, since Owen is still pretty young, I think an exciting adventure would be more appropriate.
CUSTOMER: Okay, that sounds good.
STORYBOT: Now, every great story takes place in a specific location. Would you like Owen's story to take place in the city, the country, or some otherworldly place?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking the city, since that's where we live.
STORYBOT: Perfect! Now, every story has a moral or message. What lesson do you want Owen to learn from his adventure?
CUSTOMER: I want him to learn about gratitude.
STORYBOT: Excellent choice! Now, every story needs a happy ending. Would you like Owen to save the day or simply learn from his mistakes?
CUSTOMER: I want him to save the day.
STORYBOT: Wonderful! With all of that information, I think I can start writing Owen's story. Thanks for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
