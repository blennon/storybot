STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi, Storybot. My name is Luke and I am 1 year old.
STORYBOT: Hi, Luke! 1 year old is a great age for an adventure story. Can you think of any other adventures that your child may have experienced?
CUSTOMER:

Well, my son is always exploring our house. He's always into something and getting into mischief. I think he would like a story about exploration and adventure.

STORYBOT:

That sounds like a great idea! I'm sure your son would love a story about exploration and adventure. I'm thinking about a story where the main character goes on a journey to find something important. Would you like that?
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
