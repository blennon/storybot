STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My daughter is four years old and her name is Willow.
STORYBOT: Excellent! And what does Willow like to do?
CUSTOMER: Willow is very active and loves to explore. She's always getting into mischief.
STORYBOT: Sounds like Willow is quite the handful! It sounds like she could use a lesson in self-control. Would you like your story to be about that?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I think that would be a good lesson for her.
STORYBOT: Great! Now, what kind of adventure would Willow like to go on?
CUSTOMER: She loves anything that is exciting and dangerous.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Willow is quite the daredevil! How about a story where she has to use her self-control to save the day?
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
