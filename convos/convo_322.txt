STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My protagonist is my 4 year old grandson, Aiden. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, Aiden is the star of the story. Do you have any ideas about what the story will be about?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking a comedy.
STORYBOT: That's great! Do you want the story to teach Aiden a specific lesson?
CUSTOMER: I want the story to teach him about compassion.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a comedy! Can you give me any ideas about the plot?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I just want Aiden to be the star and for the story to be really funny.
STORYBOT: I think I have enough information to get started. Thanks for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
