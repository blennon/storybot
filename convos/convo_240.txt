STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Charlotte is my 3 year old niece. She's a girl.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Charlotte is the main character of the story. Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very caring and always looks out for her little brother. She loves animals, and her favorite thing to do is read books.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a very sweet main character! Now, every good story needs a conflict, or a problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas for what kind of problem Charlotte might face in her story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure...maybe something to do with her little brother?
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! So Charlotte's problem could be that her little brother is always getting into trouble and she has to try to stop him. Does that sound good to you?
CUSTOMER: Yes, that sounds perfect!
STORYBOT: Okay, now we just need to decide on a setting and a genre for the story. Where do you think it should take place?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure...somewhere like a forest?
STORYBOT: Okay, so the story takes place in a forest. Is there anything else you can tell me about the setting?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure...maybe there are some animals in the forest that Charlotte befriends?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! So the story takes place in a forest, and Charlotte befriends some animals who help her solve her little brother's problem. Does that sound good to you?
CUSTOMER: Yes, that sounds perfect!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
