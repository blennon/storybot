CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my 4 year old nephew, Luke. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Great, now let's move on to the antagonist.
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay, we can figure it out together. Do you have any ideas for the type of story you want? It can be anything from a fairytale to an adventure story.
CUSTOMER: I want it to be a sci-fi story.
STORYBOT: Okay, a sci-fi story. Do you have any ideas for the setting?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe on a space station or something.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great setting for a sci-fi story. Are there any particular themes or lessons you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach about patience.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a story. I think we have enough information to get started. Thank you for your help.
