STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my two year old grandson, Mateo. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Thank you! Now, every good story has a conflict, or a problem. What kind of problem do you want your story to have?
CUSTOMER: I want the story to be a comedy, and I want it to teach Mateo about compassion.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! I'm sure your grandson will love it. Do you have any other ideas about the story, like what the setting should be, or what the characters might be like?
CUSTOMER:

I'm not sure, that's why I need your help! I want it to be something that he can relate to, so maybe something set in his everyday life? As for the characters, I want them to be fun and lovable, like his favorite cartoon characters.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
