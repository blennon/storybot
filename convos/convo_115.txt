STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My nephew is named Owen and he's two years old. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Owen is the main character. What else can you tell me about him?
CUSTOMER: Owen is adventurous and loves to explore. He's also very curious.
STORYBOT: Sounds like Owen is going to be a great protagonist! Now, every story needs a good antagonist. Do you have any ideas for who that could be?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I was thinking maybe a dragon?
STORYBOT: A dragon sounds like a great choice! Dragons are usually very powerful creatures, so Owen will have to be brave to defeat it.

Now, let's talk about the setting of the story. Where will Owen's adventure take place?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe in a forest?
STORYBOT: A forest is a great choice! It will be full of obstacles for Owen to overcome.

What kind of obstacles do you think he will face?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe he could get lost in the forest?
STORYBOT: Getting lost in the forest is a great obstacle! He will have to use his smarts and his courage to find his way out.

Are there any other themes or lessons you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I think it would be nice if the story could teach Owen about gratitude.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson! I'm sure Owen will be very grateful for his adventure when it's all over.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
