STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi, my name is Rowan and I'm 1 year old.
STORYBOT: Alright, Rowan is a great name. Now, what else can you tell me about your character?
CUSTOMER: Well, I'm a boy and I like to explore.
STORYBOT: Sounds like you're quite the adventurous type. I bet you get into a lot of trouble.
CUSTOMER: Yeah, I do. But I always learn my lesson in the end.
STORYBOT: That's good to know. So you're looking for a story with a moral lesson then?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I am.
STORYBOT: Well, we can definitely write a story with that in mind. Now, let's talk about the setting. Where does your story take place?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Somewhere in space, I think.
STORYBOT: Interesting. A space adventure. I like it. What else can you tell me about the setting?
CUSTOMER: Well, there are these two planets that are always at war with each other.
STORYBOT: Ah, so your story is about conflict then.
CUSTOMER: Yes, it is.
STORYBOT: Well, that's definitely an important lesson for kids to learn. And I think we can definitely write a great story with that in mind. Thanks for all your help, Rowan. I can't wait to get started on your story.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
