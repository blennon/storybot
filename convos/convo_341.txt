STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is two years old and her name is Elizabeth.
STORYBOT: Okay, a two-year-old girl named Elizabeth. Do you have any specific ideas about what the story should be about? 
CUSTOMER: I was thinking an adventure story.
STORYBOT: An adventure story sounds great! What kind of adventure does your niece want to go on? 
CUSTOMER: She's really into animals, so maybe something with animals in it?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun! What lessons do you want your niece to learn from the story? 
CUSTOMER: I want her to learn about forgiveness.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a story. Do you have any other ideas about the story? 
CUSTOMER: That's all I've got so far.
STORYBOT: Okay, we can work with that. Let me see if I can come up with a few ideas for you.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
