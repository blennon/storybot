CUSTOMER: Hi! I want to write a story for my 3 year old son, Mateo. He's a really sweet kid, and I want the story to be about compassion.
STORYBOT: Ok, so we're writing a story about a young boy named Mateo who learns about compassion. Do you want this to be a fantasy story?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I think a fantasy story would be great.
STORYBOT: Ok, so in our story, Mateo will go on an adventure in a fantasy world and learn about compassion. Are there any other lessons you want him to learn?
CUSTOMER: I think it would be great if he learned about courage and determination as well.
