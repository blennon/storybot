STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER:

My niece is Harper, she's two years old, and she's a girl.

STORYBOT:

Thanks for telling me about Harper! Now, every good story needs a conflict, or a problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas about what kind of problem Harper could face in her story?
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
