STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is Willow, she's one and a girl.
STORYBOT: Ok, Willow is one and a girl. What else can you tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very curious and loves animals.
STORYBOT: Willow is very curious and loves animals. That's great! Now, every story needs a conflict or problem for the main character to solve. What do you think Willow's conflict or problem could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's ok! Sometimes it helps to think about what lessons you want your child to learn from the story. What lessons do you want Willow to learn?
CUSTOMER: I want her to learn about courage.
STORYBOT: Ok, Willow will learn about courage. Do you have any ideas about what kind of story this could be? For example, it could be a fantasy story where Willow has to save an animal from a evil sorcerer.
CUSTOMER: That sounds interesting! I like the idea of a fantasy story.
STORYBOT: Ok, let's write a fantasy story where Willow has to save an animal from an evil sorcerer.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
