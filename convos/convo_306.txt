STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi! I would like the protagonist to be a 1 year old boy named Mateo.
STORYBOT: Okay, now let's move on to the antagonist. Do you have any ideas for who or what that could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure...
STORYBOT: That's okay, we can brainstorm a few ideas together. Would you like the antagonist to be a monster, another child, or something else entirely?
CUSTOMER: I think a monster would be good.
STORYBOT: Great! Now let's talk about the setting. Where does the story take place?
CUSTOMER: I would like it to take place in a jungle.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun! And what about the themes? Are there any particular lessons you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach about gratitude.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for children! I'm sure they will love the story.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
