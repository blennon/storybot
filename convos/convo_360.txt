STORYBOT: Okay, got it. Now, every good story needs a villain. Do you have any ideas for who that could be?
CUSTOMER: Not really, I was thinking maybe a robot or something.
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! Now, what kind of story would you like this to be? We could do a comedy, adventure, or even a mystery.
CUSTOMER: I want it to be a comedy.
STORYBOT: Excellent choice! And what lessons do you want this story to teach?

STORYBOT: Perfect! I think I have everything I need to get started. Thanks for your help!
