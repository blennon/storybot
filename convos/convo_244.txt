STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is two years old and her name is Piper.
STORYBOT: Okay, Piper is a great name! Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very active and loves to play outside. She's also very curious and loves to ask a lot of questions.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun! Do you want the story to be about Piper being active and curious, or is there something else you had in mind?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking it would be nice to teach her a lesson about kindness through the story.
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! What do you think the story should be about?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: Well, one option could be that Piper is trying to help a friend who is having a bad day. Another option could be that Piper goes on an adventure and learns the importance of being kind to others. What do you think?
CUSTOMER: I like the second option.
STORYBOT: Great! Do you want the story to be set in her backyard, or somewhere else?
CUSTOMER: Somewhere else.
STORYBOT: Okay, where would you like it to be set?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: How about a magical kingdom? Or a jungle?
CUSTOMER: A magical kingdom sounds good.
STORYBOT: Excellent choice! Are there any other themes or lessons you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: No, I think that's it.
STORYBOT: Okay, I have everything I need to write an amazing story for Piper! Thank you for your help.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
