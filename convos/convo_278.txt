STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi Storybot. The main character is my two year old nephew, Levi. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, now let's give Levi a problem. Every good story needs conflict. What kind of adventure would you like him to go on?
CUSTOMER: I want it to be a sci-fi story.
STORYBOT: Interesting. What lessons do you want your nephew to learn from this story?
CUSTOMER: I want him to learn about gratitude.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
