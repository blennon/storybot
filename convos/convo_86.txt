STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is two years old and her name is Charlotte. 
STORYBOT: Ok, so Charlotte is the main character. Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very curious and loves to explore.
STORYBOT: Excellent, so Charlotte is a curious explorer. Now, every great story needs a conflict or problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas for what Charlotte's problem could be?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe she could get lost in space and have to find her way back home.
STORYBOT: That sounds like an exciting problem for Charlotte to solve. Do you have any ideas for what kind of lessons she could learn during her adventure?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking she could learn about forgiveness.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for Charlotte to learn. Do you have any ideas for what the ending of the story could be?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe she could be forgiven by her family and learn to forgive herself.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a perfect ending for the story. Thank you for your help, I will get started on writing the story right away.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
