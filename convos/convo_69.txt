STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi! I am the parent of a 3 year old boy named Owen.
STORYBOT: Hi! Its nice to meet you. So, Owen is the main character of the story, and he is 3 years old. What else can you tell me about Owen?
CUSTOMER: He is very active and loves to explore. He is also very kind and always looks out for his little sister.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great start! Now, what kind of story are you looking to write? Is there a particular genre or type of story that you had in mind?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking a fantasy story would be nice.
STORYBOT: That sounds great! Fantasy stories are always a lot of fun. Now, what kind of lessons or themes would you like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach about kindness.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a story! Now, do you have any ideas about what the setting of the story should be?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe a magical kingdom or something like that.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great setting for a story! Now, do you have any ideas about who the antagonist of the story should be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. What do you suggest?
STORYBOT: One option for an antagonist could be a dragon. What do you think of that idea?
CUSTOMER: I like it!
STORYBOT: Great! So, the story will be about Owen, a 3 year old boy who is kind and always looks out for his little sister. The story will take place in a magical kingdom and the antagonist will be a dragon. Are you happy with that?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I think that sounds like a great story!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
