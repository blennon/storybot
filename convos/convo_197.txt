CUSTOMER: Hi! I would like the protagonist to be a one year old girl named Harper.
STORYBOT: Okay, Harper is a great name! And what about the setting of the story, where does it take place?

STORYBOT: Sounds like an exciting story! What kind of lessons or themes do you want the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach about honesty.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for kids! I think we can definitely work with that. So, is there an antagonist in the story?
