STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My main character is my one year old nephew, Aidan. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Aidan is the main character. Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
CUSTOMER: He's adventurous and loves to explore. He's also very compassionate.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great start! Now, every story needs a conflict or problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas for what Aidan's conflict could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay, we can brainstorm a few ideas. Would you like an adventure story, a mystery or something else?
CUSTOMER: An adventure story sounds good.
STORYBOT: Okay, so in an adventure story, Aidan will go on a journey and face challenges along the way. Do you have any ideas for what kind of challenges he might face?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay, we can brainstorm a few ideas. Maybe he could get lost in the forest or be captured by pirates.
CUSTOMER: That sounds good.
