STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is Harper and she's two.
STORYBOT: Okay, Harper is the main character. What else can you tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's really smart for her age. And she loves animals, especially cats.
STORYBOT: Harper sounds like a great protagonist. Now, every story needs an antagonist. Do you have any ideas for who that could be in Harper's story?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I was thinking maybe an alien?
STORYBOT: An alien could be a really fun antagonist for Harper's story. Are you thinking of a specific type of story, like a sci-fi or a fantasy?
CUSTOMER: Yes, a sci-fi. I want it to be set in space.
STORYBOT: A sci-fi story set in space sounds really cool. Do you have any ideas for what the story might be about?
CUSTOMER: I want it to be about kindness.
STORYBOT: A story about kindness is a great lesson for kids. Do you have any other ideas for what the story might be about?
CUSTOMER: I want Harper to be the one who saves the day.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Harper is the protagonist and she's going to save the day. Do you have any other ideas for the story?
CUSTOMER: That's all I've got so far.
STORYBOT: Okay, so we've got a basic idea for the story. Harper is the protagonist and she's going to save the day from an alien antagonist. The story will be set in space and be about kindness. Is there anything else you can tell me about the story?
CUSTOMER: I want there to be a happy ending.
STORYBOT: Okay, so the story will have a happy ending. Do you have any other ideas for the story?
CUSTOMER: That's all I've got for now.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
