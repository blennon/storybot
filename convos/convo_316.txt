STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi Storybot. The main character in the story is my nephew, Levi. He's three years old and a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, so we have a three-year-old boy named Levi as our main character. What else can you tell me about him?
CUSTOMER: Well, he's a sweet kid. He loves animals, and his favorite thing to do is play with his toy cars.
STORYBOT: Sounds like Levi is a fun-loving kid! Now, every great story needs a conflict, or a problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas for what Levi's conflict could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I want the story to be educational, so maybe something that teaches him a lesson?
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! What kind of lesson do you want Levi to learn?
CUSTOMER: I want him to learn about kindness.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Levi needs to learn a lesson about kindness. Do you have any ideas for how he could learn this lesson?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I was hoping you could help with that.
STORYBOT: Sure, I can help! One idea might be that Levi meets a new friend who is different from him in some way. Through their friendship, Levi learns about the importance of being kind to others.
CUSTOMER: That sounds like a great idea! I think Levi would really enjoy that story.
STORYBOT: Great! I'll get started on writing it for you.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
