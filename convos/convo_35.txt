STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is named Harper and she's one year old.
STORYBOT: Lovely! And what does Harper like to do?
CUSTOMER: She's really into exploring everything. She's always getting into things she's not supposed to.
STORYBOT: Sounds like Harper is a very curious little girl. So, we'll need an antagonist in the story to teach Harper a lesson about patience. I'm thinking maybe a character who is always rushing and never takes the time to smell the flowers, so to speak. What do you think?
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect.
STORYBOT: Great! Now, let's decide on a setting. Where would you like the story to take place?
CUSTOMER: Somewhere like a park or a farm would be nice.
STORYBOT: Perfect! And what kind of lessons do you want Harper to learn from the story?
CUSTOMER: I want her to learn the importance of being patient and taking her time.
STORYBOT: Got it! So, the story will be about Harper learning to be patient from an antagonist who is always rushing around. Does that sound good?
CUSTOMER: Yes, that sounds perfect!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
