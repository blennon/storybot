STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi Storybot. The main character is my 4 year old nephew, Rowan. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Excellent! Now that I know a bit about your main character, can you tell me what kind of adventure you would like your story to be about?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I just want it to be a fun story that teaches Rowan about self-control.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! Can you give me some more specific details about what you would like the story to be about?
CUSTOMER: Well, I was thinking maybe Rowan could go on a treasure hunt or something like that.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun! I'm sure Rowan would love going on a treasure hunt. Can you tell me what kind of lessons you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach Rowan about the importance of self-control.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson to teach! I'm sure Rowan will enjoy learning about self-control. Do you have any other ideas about what you would like the story to be about?
CUSTOMER:

No, I think that's all for now. Thank you for your help, Storybot!
