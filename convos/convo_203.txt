STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.

STORYBOT: Quinn is a great name. Do you want your story to be about a boy or a girl?
CUSTOMER: I would like it to be about a girl.
STORYBOT: Great, now we just need a few more details about our protagonist. Can you tell me what Quinn is like?

STORYBOT: That sounds like a great start. Are there any other qualities you would like to give Quinn?

STORYBOT: Quinn sounds like a great protagonist. Now, every story needs an antagonist. Do you have any ideas for who that might be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's OK. An antagonist can be anything from another person to an evil force. Let me give you some examples and you can tell me what you think.
