STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My granddaughter is 4 years old and her name is Quinn. She's a girl.
STORYBOT: Okay, now let's move on to the story's setting. Where does Quinn live?
CUSTOMER: She lives in a small town in upstate New York.
STORYBOT: That's lovely. Now, is there anything special about Quinn that we should know?
CUSTOMER: Quinn is very curious and loves to ask questions. She's also very determined.
STORYBOT: That sounds like an amazing combination. Are there any other qualities that Quinn has that you would like to share?
CUSTOMER: Quinn is also very brave. She's not afraid to stand up for what she believes in.
STORYBOT: That's terrific. Now, what is the story about?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I wanted it to be a science fiction story, but I'm not sure what it should be about.
STORYBOT: Well, science fiction is a great genre for exploring big ideas. What are some themes or lessons that you would like the story to explore?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach Quinn about self-control.
STORYBOT: That's an excellent lesson for a child to learn. Would you like the story to be about Quinn learning to control her own powers, or about someone else who is struggling to control their powers?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. What do you think would be best?
STORYBOT: I think it would be best if the story were about Quinn learning to control her own powers. That way, she can see herself in the story and learn from the character's mistakes.
CUSTOMER: That sounds like a good idea. I think Quinn would like that.
STORYBOT: Great! I think we have enough information to start writing the story. Thank you for your help.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
