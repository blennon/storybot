STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi! I want the story to be about a 1 year old boy named Aidan.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Aidan is the protagonist of the story. Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
CUSTOMER: He's a happy boy who loves to explore. He's very curious and loves to learn new things.
STORYBOT: Excellent! So Aidan is the main character and the story is about his adventures. Now, every story needs a good antagonist. Do you have any ideas for who that could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I want it to be a fantasy story, so maybe a dragon?
STORYBOT: A dragon sounds like a great antagonist! They are usually very powerful and scary, which will make the story more exciting for your little one. Now, let's talk about the setting of the story. Where do you envision Aidan's adventures taking place?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Somewhere in a magical kingdom?
STORYBOT: A magical kingdom is a great setting for a fantasy story! It opens up a lot of possibilities for exciting adventures. Are there any particular themes or lessons you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I want the story to teach about honesty.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a story! I'm sure your little one will enjoy learning about honesty through Aidan's adventures. Thank you for your help! I have everything I need to write an amazing story for your little one.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
