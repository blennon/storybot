STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My child's name is Charlotte and she is 3 years old.
STORYBOT: Got it! So Charlotte is our protagonist. Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She is very energetic and loves to laugh.
STORYBOT: Sounds like Charlotte would be the perfect protagonist for a comedy story. So, what is the story about?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I want it to be a comedy that teaches about perseverance.
STORYBOT: Great! I think I have the perfect story for Charlotte. It's called "The Little Engine That Could". It's about a small train engine that is tasked with pulling a large train over a mountain. The engine is unsure if it can do it, but with the help of its friends, it perseveres and succeeds.
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect! Thank you, Storybot.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
