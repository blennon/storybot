STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is 3 years old and her name is Harper.
STORYBOT: Harper is a great name! Now, what else can you tell me about Harper?
CUSTOMER: She's really into space, aliens and all things out of this world.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun! Now, what kind of story are you looking for? Is there a particular genre or theme you had in mind?
CUSTOMER: I'm thinking a sci-fi story with a lesson about kindness.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea! I'm sure Harper would love a story about space with a lesson about being kind. Are there any other details you can tell me about the story?
CUSTOMER:

I'm thinking Harper would be the protagonist and she would go on some kind of adventure in space. I'm not sure about the antagonist yet, but I want there to be some kind of conflict that Harper has to overcome. As for the setting, I was thinking maybe Harper's home planet or maybe some other planet in space. And I definitely want the story to be appropriate for kids.

STORYBOT:

That sounds like a great story! I'm sure Harper would love it. Are you looking for any particular lessons or themes in the story?
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
