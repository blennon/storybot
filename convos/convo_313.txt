STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My grandchild is 3 years old, male, and his name is Sebastian.
STORYBOT: Okay, Sebastian is a great name! Now that I know the basics about your main character, can you tell me what kind of adventure you would like him to go on?
CUSTOMER: Sebastian is very impatient, so I would like a story that teaches him the value of patience.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great lesson for Sebastian to learn! I have a few ideas for stories that might fit what you're looking for. Would you like to hear them?
CUSTOMER: Yes, please.
STORYBOT: One story idea is about a young boy who gets an impatience potion from a witch. Every time he gets impatient, the potion makes things go wrong for him. He has to learn to be patient in order to fix the situations he's created.
CUSTOMER: That sounds like it would be a great story for Sebastian to read. I think he would enjoy it and learn a lot from it.
STORYBOT: I'm glad you like it! I'll get started on writing the story right away.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
