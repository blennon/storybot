STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER:

My nephew is one year old and his name is Oliver. I'm not sure about his gender, but I want the story to be about a space adventure.

STORYBOT:

Great, so Oliver is the main character in your story. Can you tell me a little more about him? What does he like to do? What are his personality traits?
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
