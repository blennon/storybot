STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi! My daughter is one year old and her name is Brooklyn.
STORYBOT: Brooklyn is a great name! Now, for our story, is Brooklyn the main character?
CUSTOMER: Yes.
STORYBOT: Okay, now that we have our main character, what type of story would you like to write? A fantasy? A comedy? An adventure?
CUSTOMER: A fantasy.
STORYBOT: Excellent choice! Now, what kind of lessons would you like your story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I want the story to teach my daughter about patience.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson to teach! I have a few ideas for stories that might work. The first is about a young princess who is very impatient and always rushing into things without thinking. She gets into a lot of trouble because of it, but eventually learns the value of patience and slowing down. The second story is about a young boy who is patient and always takes his time. He is often teased by his friends for being too slow, but in the end, his patience always pays off.
CUSTOMER: I like the first story.
STORYBOT: Okay, let's go with that one then! I'll start writing the story and let you know when it's finished.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
