STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER:

My nephew's name is Rowan and he's three years old. He's a boy.

STORYBOT:

Great, so we're writing a story for a three-year-old boy named Rowan. Do you have any ideas about what kind of story you want? It can be anything from a comedy to an adventure.

CUSTOMER:

I want it to be a comedy, and I want it to teach Rowan about gratitude.

STORYBOT:

That sounds like a great idea! I'm sure Rowan will love it. Do you have any ideas about the plot?
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
