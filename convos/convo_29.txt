STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi! I'm the parent of a 3 year old girl named Charlotte.
STORYBOT: Okay! So, we're writing a story for a 3 year old girl named Charlotte. Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very active and loves to play. She's also very curious and loves to learn new things.
STORYBOT: Sounds like we have a fun-loving and energetic main character! Now, every great story needs a conflict or problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas for what our story's conflict could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I want it to be a comedy, but I'm not sure what the conflict could be.
STORYBOT: Well, one option for a comedy conflict could be that Charlotte has too much energy and is constantly getting into trouble. Her parents could be trying to find ways to help her learn to control herself. What do you think?
CUSTOMER: That sounds good! I like the idea of Charlotte learning to control herself. I think that would be a good lesson for kids.
STORYBOT: I think that's a great lesson too! So, our story will be about Charlotte learning to control her energy and not getting into so much trouble. Do you have any ideas for how the story could end?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe Charlotte could learn her lesson and be a good girl from then on?
STORYBOT: That sounds like a happy ending! I think the kids will love it. So, our story will be about Charlotte learning to control her energy and not getting into so much trouble. In the end, she learns her lesson and is a good girl from then on.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
