STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my one year old grandson, Max. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Excellent! Now that I know a little about Max, can you tell me about the setting of the story? 
CUSTOMER: I was thinking of a space setting.
STORYBOT: A space setting is very cool! Can you tell me more about it? 
CUSTOMER: I want it to be a story about honesty.
STORYBOT: That's a great moral lesson for a story! Can you think of any other lessons you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I want the story to be about family.
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! I think a space setting would be a great place to teach those lessons. Do you have any ideas about what kind of adventure Max could have in space?
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
