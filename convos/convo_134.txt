STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is Declan, he's a one year old boy.
STORYBOT: Declan is a great name! And being one year old, he's still very young. Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
CUSTOMER: He's very adventurous and always wants to explore. He's also very kind and compassionate.
STORYBOT: It sounds like Declan would be a great hero in a fantasy story! In fantasy stories, the heroes often go on grand adventures and have to overcome great challenges. They usually need to be brave and use their wits to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Do you think Declan would be up for an adventure like that?
CUSTOMER: Yes, I think he would love it!
STORYBOT: Excellent! A fantasy story with Declan as the hero sounds like it would be perfect for your grandson. I can imagine a story where Declan goes on a quest to find a magical item that will help him save the day. Along the way, he'll meet new friends and learn about the importance of compassion. Would you like me to write that story for you?
CUSTOMER: Yes, that sounds perfect! Thank you so much, Storybot!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
