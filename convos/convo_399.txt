STORYBOT: Okay, so we're looking for a light-hearted story that teaches about honesty. Do you have any ideas about what the story could be about?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I just know that I want it to be about Logan and for him to learn about honesty.
STORYBOT: Okay, let me see if I can come up with something. I think I have the perfect story for Logan. It's about a little boy named Tim who is always honest, even when it's hard. He learns that honesty is the best policy, even when his friends try to convince him to lie. In the end, Tim learns that honesty is always the best way to be.
CUSTOMER: That sounds perfect! I think Logan will love it.
