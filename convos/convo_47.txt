STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi! My child's name is Rowan and he's two years old.
STORYBOT: Got it. So Rowan is a two-year-old boy. Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
CUSTOMER: He's very active and loves to explore. He's also very curious and loves to ask a lot of questions.
STORYBOT: Sounds like Rowan is quite the little adventurer! I bet he would love a story with lots of action and exploration.

CUSTOMER: That sounds great! I also want the story to be educational and teach Rowan about gratitude.
STORYBOT: I definitely think we can work that into the story. Can you think of any other lessons or values that you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: Hmmm… I think that's it for now.
STORYBOT: Okay, I think we have enough information to get started. Thank you for your time, and I can't wait to show you the finished product!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
