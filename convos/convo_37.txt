STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: The protagonist is my 3 year old nephew, Owen. He's a boy.
STORYBOT: Okay, got it. Now that we know a little about Owen, what do you think his personality is like? Is he shy or outgoing?
CUSTOMER: Owen is a very curious and adventurous boy. He's always exploring and asking questions.
STORYBOT: That sounds like fun! So Owen is quite the little explorer. Is there anything he's afraid of?
CUSTOMER: He's afraid of the dark and of ghosts.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Owen is brave but has some fears too. That's perfectly normal. Now, onto the setting of the story. Where does Owen live?
CUSTOMER: He lives in a small town in the countryside.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a peaceful place to live. Are there any other places Owen likes to visit?
CUSTOMER: He likes to visit the nearby forest and the river.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a great place for an adventure! Now, onto the plot. What kind of story are you looking for? Is there anything you would like the story to teach Owen?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to teach Owen about courage. He's a very brave boy, but I want him to know that it's okay to be afraid sometimes too.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for Owen to learn. I think a story about Owen overcoming his fears would be perfect. Would you like me to write that for you?
CUSTOMER: Yes, that would be perfect. Thank you, Storybot!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
