CUSTOMER: She loves animals and she's very kind.
STORYBOT: That's great! So Elizabeth is a kind, animal-loving two-year-old girl. Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: That's all I can think of.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Elizabeth is a kind, animal-loving two-year-old girl. What kind of story would you like me to write about her?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. Maybe a comedy?
STORYBOT: A comedy, huh? Do you have any ideas about what the story would be about?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I just want it to be appropriate for a two-year-old and teach her a lesson about kindness.
STORYBOT: I think I have the perfect story for Elizabeth! It's a comedy about a little girl who learns the importance of being kind to animals. I'm sure she'll love it!
