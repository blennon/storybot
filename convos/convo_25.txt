STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My son is 1 year old and his name is Owen.
STORYBOT: Okay, so we have a 1 year old boy named Owen. Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
CUSTOMER: He's very active and loves to explore.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun. What does he like to explore?
CUSTOMER: Everything. He's curious about everything.
STORYBOT: That's great. So, he's a curious little boy. Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
CUSTOMER: He's very impatient.
STORYBOT: That's understandable for a 1 year old. They're still learning to understand the world and how things work. Patience is a great lesson for him to learn.

STORYBOT: Now that I know a little more about Owen, I have some story ideas that I think he would enjoy. One is a fantasy story about a young boy who goes on an adventure to find a lost treasure. Along the way, he learns the importance of patience. Would that be something you're interested in?
CUSTOMER: Yes, that sounds perfect.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
