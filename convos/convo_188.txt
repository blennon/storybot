STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Harper is my 3 year old niece. She's a very sweet girl.
STORYBOT: What a lovely name! And what does Harper like to do?
CUSTOMER: She loves to play outside, and she's really into animals right now.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun. So, Harper is the main character in your story. Are there any other characters you would like to include?
CUSTOMER:

Well, my sister is Harper's mother, so she could be a character. And Harper's father could be a character too.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
