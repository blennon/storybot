STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My daughter is 1 year old and her name is Aurora.
STORYBOT: Okay, Aurora is a great name! Now, what else can you tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very curious and loves to explore.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun! Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's also very brave and always stands up for what she believes in.
STORYBOT: Wow, she sounds like an amazing little girl! Now, what kind of story are you looking for? Is there a particular genre or theme you had in mind?
CUSTOMER: I'm not really sure. I just want a story that's appropriate for a 1 year old and that teaches about gratitude.
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! I think a sci-fi story would be perfect for Aurora. What do you think about that?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I've never really been a fan of sci-fi.
STORYBOT: Well, let me tell you a little bit about the story. In it, Aurora would be on a space adventure with her friends. They would visit different planets and meet new creatures. Along the way, they would learn about the importance of being grateful for what they have.
CUSTOMER: That actually sounds really fun! I think Aurora would love it.
STORYBOT: I think so too! I'll get started on the story right away. Thanks for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
