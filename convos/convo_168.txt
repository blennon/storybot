STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is 1 year old and her name is Piper.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Piper is the main character. Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very adventurous and loves to explore.
STORYBOT: That sounds like Piper will be a great protagonist! Now, every story needs an antagonist. Do you have any ideas for who that could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay, we can brainstorm a few options together. Would you like a male or female antagonist?
CUSTOMER: Male, I think.
STORYBOT: Okay, a male antagonist. Do you want him to be human or non-human?
CUSTOMER: Non-human.
STORYBOT: Great, so we have a non-human male antagonist. Do you want him to be a monster, an alien or something else?
CUSTOMER: An alien.
STORYBOT: Okay, an alien antagonist. Now, every story needs a setting. Where do you want this story to take place?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay, we can brainstorm a few options together. Would you like it to take place on Earth or another planet?
CUSTOMER: Another planet.
STORYBOT: Okay, a different planet. Do you want it to be a desert planet, a water planet or something else?
CUSTOMER: A water planet.
STORYBOT: Okay, a water planet. Now, every story needs a theme. What do you want this story to be about?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay, we can brainstorm a few options together. Would you like it to be about friendship, family or something else?
CUSTOMER: Compassion.
STORYBOT: Okay, compassion. Now, every story needs a lesson. What do you want your little one to learn from this story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: That's okay, we can brainstorm a few options together. Would you like the lesson to be about being brave, being kind or something else?
