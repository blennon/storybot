STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is one year old and her name is Harper. She's a girl. 
STORYBOT: One year old, got it. And what does Harper like to do?
CUSTOMER: She likes to explore and is very curious.
STORYBOT: Harper sounds like she would be a great protagonist for an adventure story! Is there anything in particular you would like the story to be about?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to be about forgiveness.
STORYBOT: That's a great lesson for a story! What kind of adventure does Harper go on in the story?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure.
STORYBOT: Well, let's brainstorm some ideas. Does Harper go on a treasure hunt? Or does she try to save a friend in danger?
CUSTOMER: I like the idea of Harper going on a treasure hunt.
STORYBOT: Great! So in the story, Harper goes on a treasure hunt and learns about forgiveness. Does that sound good?
CUSTOMER: Yes, that sounds perfect!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
