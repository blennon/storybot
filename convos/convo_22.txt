STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER:

 My main character is a 3 year old girl named Quinn. 

STORYBOT: Excellent! Now, every story needs a problem or conflict for the main character to face. Do you have any ideas about what kind of problem Quinn might face in your story?
CUSTOMER:

I'm not sure. I was thinking maybe something involving space travel?

STORYBOT: That sounds like a great idea for a sci-fi story! Does Quinn have any other characteristics that you would like to highlight in the story?

CUSTOMER:

I would like the story to focus on courage.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
