STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My niece is 3 years old and her name is Abigail.
STORYBOT: Okay, Abigail is a great name! Do you know what gender your 3 year old niece is?
CUSTOMER: Abigail is a girl.
STORYBOT: Okay, now that we know our main character is a 3 year old girl named Abigail, what would you like the story to be about?
CUSTOMER: I would like the story to be about forgiveness.
STORYBOT: That's a great message for a children's story. Forgiveness is a virtue that can be difficult to learn, but it's an important lesson for kids. Do you have any ideas about what the story could be about?
CUSTOMER: Not really. I just know that I want it to be a comedy and teach Abigail about forgiveness.
STORYBOT: Okay, so a comedy that teaches Abigail about forgiveness. That sounds like a great story! Do you have any ideas about what the plot could be?
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
