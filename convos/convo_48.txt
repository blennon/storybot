STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: Hi Storybot. The main character is my two year old granddaughter, Willow. 
STORYBOT: Excellent! So Willow is two years old and female. Is there anything else you can tell me about her?
CUSTOMER: She's very adventurous and loves to explore. She's also very curious and likes to ask a lot of questions.
STORYBOT: That sounds like a lot of fun! Now, every great story needs a conflict or problem for the main character to solve. Do you have any ideas for what Willow's conflict could be?
CUSTOMER: I'm not sure. I was thinking maybe something involving aliens or space travel?
STORYBOT: That sounds like an exciting adventure! I'm sure Willow would love to explore space and meet some friendly aliens.
CUSTOMER: Yes, I think she would.
STORYBOT: Great! Now, every story needs a lesson or moral at the end. What do you want Willow to learn from her adventure?
CUSTOMER: I want her to learn about forgiveness.
STORYBOT: That's a very important lesson! I'm sure Willow will be a better person for learning it.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
