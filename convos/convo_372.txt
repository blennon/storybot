STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My main character is my one year old granddaughter, Chloe.
STORYBOT: Excellent! Now, do you have any ideas about what kind of story you would like? For example, is it a bedtime story, or a story about her favorite animal?
CUSTOMER: I would like a story that is educational and teaches about kindness.
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! I'm sure your granddaughter will love it. Are there any other themes or lessons you would like the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: No, I think that kindness is a great lesson for a 1 year old.
STORYBOT: I couldn't agree more! Now, do you have any ideas about the plot of the story?
CUSTOMER: Not really, I was hoping you could help with that.
STORYBOT: Of course! I would be happy to help. One idea I had was a story about a little girl who helps a lost puppy find its way home. Would you like me to develop this further, or do you have another idea?
CUSTOMER: That sounds great, please continue.
STORYBOT: Okay, so in the story, the little girl finds a lost puppy and decides to help it find its way home. Along the way, she learns about the importance of being kind and helping others. Would you like to add anything else to the story?
CUSTOMER: No, I think that sounds perfect. Thank you so much for your help!
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
