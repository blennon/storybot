STORYBOT: Hi, I’m Storybot, a friendly AI that will help write an amazing story for your little one. Since every great story starts with a main character, can you tell me about your’s? It helps to know their name, age and gender.
CUSTOMER: My nephew is one year old and his name is Luke.
STORYBOT: Okay, so Luke is the protagonist of the story. Now, every story needs an antagonist. Do you have any ideas for who that could be?
CUSTOMER: Not really, I was thinking maybe an evil wizard?
STORYBOT: That's a great idea! Now, what kind of story do you want to write? A fantasy? A adventure? A comedy?
CUSTOMER: I want it to be a fantasy.
STORYBOT: Okay, a fantasy it is! And what setting do you want the story to take place in?
CUSTOMER: I was thinking maybe a magical kingdom?
STORYBOT: That sounds great! And what lessons do you want the story to teach?
CUSTOMER: I want it to teach about self-control.
STORYBOT: Okay, so the story will be about Luke, an evil wizard, and a magical kingdom. It will teach about self-control. Is there anything else you can tell me about the story?
CUSTOMER: That's all I have for now.
STORYBOT: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story? If not, you can say ALL DONE.
CUSTOMER: ALL DONE.
