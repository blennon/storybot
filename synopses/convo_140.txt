Willow is a happy and curious two year old girl. She loves to explore her house and the places she goes to often, like the park and the grocery store. One day, while she is playing with her friends at daycare, she finds a toy that she really wants. When her friends tell her she can't have it because she doesn't have any money, Willow decides to take the toy anyway. When her parents find out, they sit her down and explain to her the importance of honesty. They tell her that it's okay to make mistakes, but it's important to always be truthful. Through her parents' guidance and her own misadventures, Willow learns the value of honesty and grows into a more responsible person.
