Once upon a time, there was a four year old girl named Charlotte who was always kind and looked out for others, even if they didn't always reciprocate. Charlotte loved animals and spending time outdoors in her family's castle. One day, when Charlotte was out exploring the forest near her home, she came across a wounded bird. Even though the bird had hurt her, Charlotte decided to help it. She took it back to the castle and nursed it back to health. Once the bird was better, it flew away. 

Later that day, Charlotte was playing in the forest again when she ran into a group of kids who were picking on a smaller child. Charlotte stood up for the child and helped them get away. The kids didn't thank her or reciprocate her kindness, but Charlotte didn't mind. She knew that it was always better to be kind, even if people don't always reciprocate. And she was happy that she could help someone in need.
