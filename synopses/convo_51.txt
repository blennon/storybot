Willow is a 3-year-old girl who is very curious. She always wants to know why things are the way they are and why people do the things they do. One day, she asks her mom why it's important to always be honest. Her mom tells her that it's because when you're honest, people know they can trust you and they can rely on you. Willow thinks about this and decides to put it to the test. She goes to her friend's house and asks to borrow a toy. Her friend says yes, but only if she promises to be honest and return the toy when she's done with it. Willow agrees and takes the toy home. She plays with it for a few days, but then she starts to get bored with it. She decides to take it back to her friend's house, but when she gets there, she sees that her friend is playing with a new toy. She's about to go home when her friend sees her and asks her if she wants to play with the new toy. Willow is torn. She knows she should return the toy she borrowed, but she really wants to play with the new toy. She decides to be honest and tells her friend that she borrowed the toy and wants to return it. Her friend is happy to have the toy back and they play together with the new toy. Willow learns that being honest is always the best policy.
