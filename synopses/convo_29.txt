Charlotte is a 3 year old girl with a lot of energy. She loves to play and is always getting into trouble. Her parents are trying to find ways to help her learn to control herself.

One day, Charlotte's parents decide to take her to the park. Charlotte loves the park and starts running around and playing. She gets so excited that she starts to run into other people and knock things over. Her parents scold her and tell her to calm down.

Charlotte doesn't want to calm down and starts to cry. Her parents take her home and she goes to her room. Charlotte is so angry that she throws her toys and doesn't want to play anymore.

Later, Charlotte's parents talk to her and explain that she needs to learn to control her energy. They tell her that if she can't calm down, she won't be able to go to the park anymore. Charlotte doesn't want to listen and runs out of the room.

The next day, Charlotte's parents take her to the park again. This time, Charlotte tries to be good. She plays quietly and doesn't run around. She has so much fun that she doesn't want to go home.

When they get home, Charlotte's parents tell her that she did a good job and she can go to the park again. Charlotte is happy and learns her lesson. She knows that she needs to control her energy so she doesn't get into trouble.
