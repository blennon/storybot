Once upon a time there was a four-year-old girl named Piper who was very outgoing and loved to have adventures. She was always looking for new things to do and was very brave. One day, Piper went on a big adventure with her family and friends. They went to the park, the zoo and even the library. Piper had so much fun and learned a lot about courage, family and friends, and responsibility. In the end, she was very tired but very happy.
