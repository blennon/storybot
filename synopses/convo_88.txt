Owen is a happy, active four-year-old boy who loves to run around outside and make up stories with his stuffed animals. He can be quite stubborn at times, but that doesn't stop him from being a lovable child.

One day, Owen's aunt takes him on a special outing. They go to a nearby park where Owen has never been before. As soon as they arrive, Owen begins to explore. He climbs on the jungle gym, swings on the swings, and slides down the slide. He even makes up a game of his own and invites his aunt to play.

After a while, Owen's aunt tells him it's time to go. Owen doesn't want to leave; he's having too much fun. But his aunt assures him that they will come back to the park again soon.

Owen reluctantly agrees and they head home. On the way, Owen's aunt tells him a story about a boy who loved to explore just like he does. By the time they arrive home, Owen is fast asleep.

This story is about a boy named Owen who loves to explore and have adventures. It teaches children the importance of listening to adults and following rules. It also shows that even though rules are important, it's okay to have fun and be creative.
