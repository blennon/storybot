Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Luke who lived on a farm. He was very active and loved to explore his surroundings. He was also very curious and loved to learn new things.

One day, Luke's curiosity got the best of him and he wandered off into the forest. He soon found himself in front of a large, dark cave. He was about to turn and go back the way he came when he heard a noise coming from inside the cave.

Despite his better judgment, Luke decided to investigate. He slowly made his way into the cave, following the noise. The further he went, the darker and more treacherous the cave became.

Finally, he came to a clearing and in the center of the clearing was a large, dragon. The dragon was asleep, but it was clear that it was the source of the noise.

Luke was terrified, but he knew he had to find a way to get past the dragon. He tried to sneak around it, but the dragon woke up and started to chase him. Luke ran as fast as he could, but he was no match for the dragon.

Just when it seemed like the dragon was about to catch him, Luke remembered what his mom had always told him: "Be patient and good things will happen." He stopped running and waited for the dragon to catch up to him.

When the dragon was close enough, Luke jumped onto its back and held on tight. The dragon was so surprised that it forgot to chase Luke. Instead, it started flying around the cave, showing Luke all the amazing sights.

After a while, the dragon flew Luke back to the farm. Luke was safe and sound, and he had learned a valuable lesson.
