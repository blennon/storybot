Luke is a 2 year old boy who is always trying to be honest. This often gets him into comical situations. For example, one time he was at the park with his mom and he saw a little girl drop her ice cream. He ran over to her and tried to give her his own ice cream so she wouldn't be sad. His mom had to explain to him that the little girl's mom would buy her a new ice cream. Another time, he was playing with his friends and one of them said a bad word. Luke thought it was a bad word too and told his mom about it. She had to explain to him that it wasn't a bad word and that he shouldn't tell on his friends. Even though he often gets into trouble because of his honesty, he always means well and his family and friends love him for it.
