Owen is a 3 year old boy who lives in a small town in the countryside. He's a very curious and adventurous boy who likes to explore and ask questions. He's afraid of the dark and of ghosts.

One day, Owen decides to explore the nearby forest. He's never been there before, but he's heard stories about the magical creatures that live there. He's also heard stories about the dangerous creatures that live there too.

Owen is a little scared, but he's also very excited. He takes his first steps into the forest and immediately hears a noise. He's not sure what it is, but he knows it's something big. He slowly approaches the noise and sees a big, furry creature. He's never seen anything like it before!

The creature is friendly and wants to play with Owen. Owen is hesitant at first, but he soon warms up to the creature. They play together all day and Owen forgets all about his fears.

When it's time to go home, Owen says goodbye to his new friend and promises to come back soon. He's learned that there's nothing to be afraid of in the forest and that there are some really amazing creatures living there.
