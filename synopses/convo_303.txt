Mateo is a two year old boy who loves his cartoon characters. One day, he sees a homeless man on the street and feels compelled to help him. He asks his mom for some money to give to the man, and she agrees. Mateo runs up to the man and hands him the money, but the man just looks at him and walks away. Mateo is confused and feels like he's done something wrong.

His mom explains to him that sometimes people are in a bad place and they don't always know how to accept help. Mateo learns that even though he didn't fix the man's problem, he did something kind and that made him feel good.
