Rowan is a 3 year old boy who loves to explore and ask questions. He is very active and curious, which sometimes gets him into trouble. One day, while he is exploring his backyard, he finds a strange looking rock. He picks it up and starts to play with it, not realizing that it is actually a piece of alien technology. The rock starts to glow and a beam of light surrounds Rowan, transporting him to another planet.

Rowan is now on a planet that is very different from Earth. He meets some friendly aliens who show him around and introduce him to the different types of technology that they have. Rowan is fascinated by everything he sees and wants to know more. However, he gets a little too curious and starts to play with one of the aliens' devices without permission. This causes some damage and the aliens are not happy.

The aliens explain to Rowan that he needs to learn to control himself if he wants to stay on their planet. They give him some exercises to do to help him learn self-control. Rowan works hard and eventually learns to control himself. The aliens are so impressed with his progress that they decide to let him stay on their planet. Rowan is excited to continue exploring and learning about all the different alien technologies.
