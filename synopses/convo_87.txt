Owen is a two year old boy who loves to explore and learn new things. He can be a bit impulsive, though, and doesn't always think before he acts. In this science fiction story, Owen will learn about the importance of self-control.

The story begins with Owen exploring a new planet. He's excited to learn about all the different creatures and plants he finds there. He soon comes across a creature that he's never seen before. It's a big, friendly creature that Owen immediately wants to play with.

Before he knows it, Owen is chasing the creature all around the planet. They're having so much fun that Owen doesn't realize how tired he's getting. Eventually, he starts to slow down and the creature gets away from him.

Owen is sad that he lost the creature, but he's also happy that he got to explore the planet and learn about self-control. He learns that it's important to know when to stop and take a break, even when you're having fun.
