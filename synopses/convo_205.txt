Owen is a two-year-old boy who lives in a small cottage with his grandparents. One day, a dragon appears in the forest near their home. Owen's grandfather tells him that the dragon is a magical creature who can grant wishes.

Owen is initially scared of the dragon, but he decides to make a wish for a new toy. The dragon grants his wish and Owen is so happy that he decides to make a wish for the dragon in return. He wishes that the dragon could find a new home.

The dragon is so grateful for Owen's wish that he decides to stay near the cottage and become Owen's friend. From then on, Owen and the dragon have many adventures together and learn important lessons about gratitude along the way.
