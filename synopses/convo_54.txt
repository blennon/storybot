Rowan is a happy and curious two-year-old boy who loves to laugh and make others laugh. He is also very compassionate. One day, Rowan's parents tell him that they are going to the store and they will be gone for a little while. Rowan asks if he can help and his parents say yes. They give him a list of things to do while they are gone including feeding the dog, checking the mail, and watering the plants. Rowan is happy to help and he does a great job. His parents are very proud of him.

While his parents are gone, Rowan hears a knock at the door. He opens it and sees his neighbor's cat, Simon. Simon looks sad and Rowan knows that he is lonely. He invites Simon inside and they become friends. They play together until it is time for Rowan's parents to come home. Rowan's parents are happy to see Simon and they thank Rowan for being such a good friend.
