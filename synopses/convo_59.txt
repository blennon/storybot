Willow is a two-year-old girl who loves to laugh and explore. She's very curious, and one day she decides to go on an adventure in her backyard. Willow climbs up a tree and onto the roof of her house, where she finds a little bird's nest. She's never seen a bird's nest before, and she's curious to know what's inside. Willow carefully opens the nest and looks inside, but she accidentally knocks it over. All the baby birds fall out of the nest and Willow starts to cry. She feels terrible and doesn't know how to fix the situation. Luckily, her mom hears her crying and comes to see what's wrong. Willow's mom helps her put the baby birds back in the nest and explains that she needs to be more careful in the future. Willow learns her lesson and is happy to have helped the baby birds.
