Meet Timmy, a young boy who loves going on adventures with his friends. They spend their days exploring the woods near their homes, looking for treasures.

One day, they find a map that leads them to a secret cave. They enter the cave and start to explore, but soon get lost. Timmy finds a lantern and lights it, which reveals a hidden passage. They follow the passage and find themselves in a large room filled with treasure. Timmy's friends start to fill their pockets with the treasure, but Timmy finds a golden necklace and decides to keep it.

As they are leaving the cave, they are caught by the owner of the treasure. He explains that the treasure belongs to him and Timmy's friends start to hand back the treasure they took. Timmy is about to give back the necklace when he sees the owner's mean dog. He decides to keep the necklace and give it to the dog to distract him while they escape.

The owner is so impressed by Timmy's honesty that he decides to give him the necklace as a reward. Timmy learns that it's more important to be honest than to get what you want.
