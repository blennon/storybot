Rowan is a 3 year old boy who loves to explore and build things. He's an only child, but he's close to his grandparents. He's curious and loves learning new things.

One day, Rowan's grandparents take him to the zoo. Rowan loves seeing all the different animals, but he's especially excited to see the elephants. He's never seen elephants before and he can't wait to learn all about them.

At the zoo, Rowan gets to see the elephants up close. He learns that they are big and strong, and he even gets to feed them. He has a great time at the zoo and he can't wait to go back again.
