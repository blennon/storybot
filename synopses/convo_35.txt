Harper is a curious one-year-old who loves to explore everything. She's always getting into things she's not supposed to. One day, Harper goes to the park with her Auntie. Auntie is busy reading her book and doesn't pay much attention to Harper. Harper wanders off and finds a ladybug. She's never seen a ladybug before and is curious about it. She tries to catch it, but it keeps flying away. Harper gets frustrated and starts to cry. Auntie comes over and explains to Harper that she needs to be patient if she wants to catch the ladybug. Harper doesn't understand what "patient" means, so Auntie shows her. They sit down and wait for the ladybug to come back. After a few minutes, the ladybug lands on Harper's hand. Harper is excited and happy that she was able to catch it. She learns that being patient can be rewarding.
