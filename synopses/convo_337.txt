Ryder is a two-year-old boy who loves to explore and is always curious. He's also very brave and is never afraid to try new things. One day, Ryder and his family go on a picnic. Ryder loves to run around and explore the park. He also loves to ask his parents a lot of questions. When it's time to go home, Ryder doesn't want to leave and his parents have to carry him out of the park kicking and screaming. But when they get home, Ryder is happy to see his dog waiting for him.
