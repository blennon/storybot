Harper is an impulsive two-year-old adventurer who loves to explore. She's also very curious and determined, and never gives up on something she's set her mind to. Harper is always up for a challenge, no matter how difficult it may be. She's also very friendly, and loves to meet new people and make new friends.

One day, Harper sets off on a new adventure. She climbs to the top of a tall tree in her backyard and looks out over the fence into the neighbor's yard. She sees a big, friendly dog and decides she wants to meet it. Harper climbs down from the tree and runs over to the fence. She climbs up the fence and tries to reach the dog, but she can't quite reach it. She keeps trying, and finally she succeeds in petting the dog.
