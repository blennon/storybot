Owen is a four year old boy who loves to teach other kids lessons of gratitude. When he learns that some of his friends at school are unhappy because they don't have enough to be thankful for, Owen comes up with a plan to show them just how much they have to be grateful for.

Owen starts a gratitude journal with his friends, and each day they list things they are thankful for. At first, some of the kids are skeptical, but soon they all start to see just how much they have to be grateful for in their lives.

The gratitude journal becomes a big hit at school, and Owen is soon known as the "gratitude kid". He teaches his friends that no matter what life throws their way, there is always something to be grateful for.
