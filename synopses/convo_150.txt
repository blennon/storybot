Once upon a time there was a little girl named Charlotte. She was one year old and loved to explore her world. One day, while she was exploring, she found a toy that she really wanted. But when she went to pick it up, she saw that it belonged to someone else. What should she do? Should she take the toy and keep it for herself, or should she be honest and give it back to the owner?

 Charlotte has lots of adventures as she tries to figure out what it means to be honest. She makes some new friends along the way and learns that honesty is always the best policy. In the end, she returns the toy to its rightful owner and everyone is happy.
