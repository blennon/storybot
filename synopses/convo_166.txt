Quinn is a curious three-year-old girl who loves to learn new things. She is the protagonist of an educational story that teaches honesty as its moral lesson.

The story begins with Quinn asking her mother a question about why the sky is blue. Her mother explains that it has to do with the way sunlight reflects off of the particles in the atmosphere. Quinn is fascinated by this and asks her mother to tell her more about it.

This leads to a series of events in which Quinn learns about different aspects of the scientific explanations for why things are the way they are. She also learns that there are some things that we don't yet understand and that scientists are still working to figure them out.

Throughout the story, Quinn is faced with opportunities to be dishonest. But each time, she decides to be truthful instead. In the end, Quinn learns that honesty is always the best policy and that it's okay to admit when you don't know something.
