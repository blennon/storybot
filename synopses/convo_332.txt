In this adventure story for children, we meet our main character, Elliott, a young boy who is two years old. Elliott is full of energy and loves to explore, which sometimes gets him into trouble. One day, Elliott's curiosity gets the best of him and he wanders off into the forest, despite his mother's warnings not to.

As Elliott explores the forest, he comes across a big, scary bear. The bear is about to eat Elliott when Elliott's mother arrives just in time and scares the bear away. Elliott is very apologetic and promises to never wander off into the forest again.

This story is not only exciting, but also teaches a valuable lesson about forgiveness. Elliott's mother forgives him for disobeying her and wandering off into the forest, and in turn, Elliott learns to forgive himself.
