Natalie is a fun-loving four year old girl with a big imagination. She loves to play outside with her friends, and make up stories. One day, Natalie and her friends are playing in the backyard when they discover a secret garden. They spend the day exploring the garden and making up stories about the different plants and animals they see. Natalie's grandma tells them that the garden was created by a woman who loved to tell stories. She used to write down all of the stories she made up in a book, and the garden was her inspiration. The woman had to move away, but she left her book behind for Natalie and her friends to find. Natalie and her friends decide to start their own story club, and they meet in the secret garden every day to write down their stories. They each take turns reading their stories aloud to the group, and everyone applauds when they finish. Natalie's grandma comes to visit one day, and she is so proud of Natalie and her friends. She gives them each a copy of the woman's book to keep, and they promise to write their own stories in it.
