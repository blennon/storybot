Quinn is a two year old girl who loves to explore her world. She's always getting into mischief, but she means well. Her aunt (the story's narrator) loves her dearly and is always there to help her learn lessons, even if they are sometimes hard ones.

In this particular story, Quinn gets into some trouble when she takes her aunt's car for a joyride. She doesn't mean to cause any harm, but she ends up damaging the car. Her aunt is very upset at first, but she quickly forgives Quinn when she sees how sorry she is. She uses the incident as a teachable moment to show Quinn the importance of being careful and mindful of other people's property. In the end, Quinn learns her lesson and the story ends on a happy note.
