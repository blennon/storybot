Willow is a 3 year old girl who is very active and curious. She loves to explore her house and play with her friends, but she knows that she has to be careful not to make too much noise or else she'll wake up her baby brother. One day, Willow's parents go out and she decides to take advantage of the opportunity to explore. She starts to look around the house, but she quickly realizes that there's more to explore outside. She opens the door to the backyard and sees her friends playing. They spot her and invite her to join their treasure hunt. Willow is excited to join in, but she knows that she has to be careful not to get too dirty or else her mom won't let her go to the park afterwards. She has a great time with her friends, but she eventually gets tired and goes home. She is happy to have had such a fun adventure, but she knows that she needs to be more careful in the future.
