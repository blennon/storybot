Aidan is a 4 year old boy who likes to play with his toys and run around outside. He is mostly a loner, but he does have a few friends that he likes to play with. His parents are always telling him to be careful and not to run into the street, but one day when he is playing with his friends, he gets too excited and runs into the street without looking both ways. A car is coming and his friends start screaming, but Aidan doesn't hear them. He is about to run into the street when his mother grabs him and pulls him back just in time. She scolds him and tells him that he could have been hurt or even killed if she hadn't been there. Aidan is very sorry and promises to be more careful in the future.
