Savannah is a fun-loving two-year-old girl. She loves to explore her world and has a curiosity for everything. Her favorite pastime is playing outside with her friends, where she can use her imagination to its fullest.

One day, while Savannah is playing in her backyard, she stumbles upon a mysterious object. It's a shining silver key! She has never seen anything like it before and is instantly intrigued. She picks it up and starts to explore with it, trying to figure out what it does.

As she is playing, the key starts to glow and a door appears in the middle of the backyard! Savannah is amazed and excited to see what is on the other side. She steps through the door and finds herself in a beautiful garden.

There are flowers of all colors, trees with ripe fruit, and a bubbling stream running through it. She spends the day exploring the garden and making new friends with the animals. As the sun starts to set, she finds herself getting sleepy.

She lays down under a tree and falls asleep. When she wakes up, she is back in her backyard with the key in her hand. She knows she will always remember her magical day in the garden and will cherish the key forever.
