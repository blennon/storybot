Aria is a curious and cautious 3 year old girl who loves to play and learn new things. She lives with her parents and her little dog Mia in a house with a backyard. One day, Aria's parents go out and leave her with a babysitter. Aria is bored and wants to explore, so she starts to wander around the house. She finds a box of crayons and starts to color. Mia sees the crayons and wants to play too, so Aria starts to color with her. They make a big mess, but Aria's parents are happy to see the drawing she made when they come home.

The next day, Aria and Mia are playing in the backyard when they see a cat walking by. Mia wants to chase the cat, but Aria is afraid that the cat will scratch her. Mia runs after the cat anyway, and Aria follows. The cat leads them to a tree, and Mia starts to bark. Aria looks up and sees a bird's nest with three little eggs in it. The cat is trying to get to the eggs, but Aria doesn't want the cat to hurt them. She tries to shoo the cat away, but it doesn't work. Mia starts to chase the cat and Aria follows. They chase the cat all around the neighborhood until they finally catch it. Aria takes the cat home and puts it in her backyard, where it can't hurt the bird's eggs.

Aria learns that it is important to be kind to others, even if they are different from you. She also learns that it is important to be brave and stand up for what you believe in.
