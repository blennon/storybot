Luke is a happy 2 year old who loves to explore. One day, Luke's parents take him to the park. Luke sees a big slide and runs over to it. He climbs up the slide and then slides down. When he gets to the bottom, he sees a big puddle of mud. He splashes in the mud and gets himself dirty. His parents tell him it's time to go home and they head home. When they get home, Luke's mom gives him a bath. He plays in the bathtub for a while before getting out and getting ready for bed. His mom tucks him in and kisses him goodnight. Luke falls asleep and has sweet dreams.
