Later that day, Aidan's parents come home and they are surprised to see that Aidan is very dirty. Aidan's father asks him what happened and Aidan tells him that he was trying to help his grandmother with the gardening. Aidan's father is very proud of him and he thanks him for his help.

Aidan's father then takes him outside to play. Aidan is very happy and he enjoys playing with his father. This experience teaches Aidan about the importance of gratitude.
