Levi is a one year old boy who lives in a future world where robots are a part of everyday life. One day, Levi's parents leave him home with the family robot while they go out to run some errands. Levi gets into the robot's control panel and accidentally deletes all of the files that contain the family's memories. When Levi's parents come home and find out what he has done, they are upset and frustrated. However, they quickly forgive Levi and realize that even though their memories are gone, they can still make new ones together as a family.
