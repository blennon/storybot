Once upon a time there was a little girl named Charlotte. She was two years old and loved to explore her world. One day, while she was playing in her backyard, she found a curious looking rock. She picked it up and took it inside to show her mom. Her mom was very excited to see the rock and told Charlotte that it was a magic rock.

The magic rock could grant wishes. Charlotte was so excited that she immediately started making wishes. She wished for a new toy, a bigger backyard, and for her mom to always be happy.

Suddenly, the magic rock started to glow. It started granting Charlotte's wishes one by one. Her toy appeared, the backyard started to grow, and her mom's smile got bigger and bigger.

 Charlotte was so happy that she wished for the magic rock to stay with her forever. And it did! The magic rock granted all of Charlotte's wishes and they lived happily ever after.
