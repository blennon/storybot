Grayson is a four year old boy who loves to explore. He's always getting into mischief, much to the dismay of his parents and grandparents. One day, while Grayson is playing in the backyard, he finds a small hole in the ground. He starts to dig with his hands and soon discovers a hidden tunnel. He crawls inside and starts to explore. Suddenly, he hears a noise coming from the other end of the tunnel. He's scared at first, but then he sees a small mouse peeking out from the darkness. Grayson is excited to make a new friend and the two of them start to play. They play until it's time for Grayson to go home for dinner. He promises to come back and explore the tunnel some more with his new friend.
