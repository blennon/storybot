Landon is a 1 year old boy who loves to explore and ask questions. He is always on the move, curious about everything around him. One day, while he is playing in his backyard, he finds a curious looking rock. He picks it up and starts to examine it, when he suddenly hears a noise coming from inside the rock. He looks closer and sees a tiny door. He opens the door and peeks inside, when he is suddenly pulled inside by a gust of wind.

Landon finds himself in a strange new world. He starts to explore, when he comes across a big tree. He climbs to the top of the tree and looks out over the world. He sees a group of animals running and playing. He climbs down and joins them. He has so much fun playing with his new friends that he forgets all about trying to find a way home.

Later, Landon starts to get tired and hungry. He asks his new friends if they know the way back to his world, but they don't know. They all start to look for a way back, but they can't find one. Landon starts to worry that he may never see his family again.

Just when Landon is about to give up, they find a tiny door in a tree. They all squeeze through the door and Landon finds himself back in his own backyard. He is so happy to be home that he gives his new rock a big hug.
