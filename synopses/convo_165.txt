Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Harper. Harper loved to play make believe and dress up. She was always pretending to be a princess or a fairy. One day, she decided to go on an adventure. She climbed up a tall tree in her backyard and pretended she was in a faraway land. Suddenly, she slipped and fell. She hurt her ankle and started to cry. Her mom came outside and saw her. She was so proud of Harper for being brave and never giving up. She hugged her and kissed her better. Harper learned that even though she might fall down, she can always get back up and try again.
