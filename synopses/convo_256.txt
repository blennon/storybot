As Sarah walks through the forest, she hears strange noises and sees strange creatures. She is not scared, and she continues to walk deeper into the forest. She eventually comes to a clearing, and in the center of the clearing is a large tree. Sarah climbs the tree and looks around. From the top of the tree, she can see for miles. She can see her town, the forest and the mountains in the distance. It is beautiful.

Sarah climbs down from the tree and starts to walk back home, but she takes a wrong turn and gets lost. She is scared now, and she starts to cry. She sits down and starts to think about what to do. Suddenly, she hears a noise. It is a bear! The bear is walking towards her. Sarah is terrified, but she stands up and faces the bear. She is not going to let it scare her.

The bear does not attack Sarah. It stands next to her and looks at her. Then, it starts to walk away. Sarah follows the bear and it leads her back to the clearing with the big tree. From there, she is able to find her way home.

Sarah has learned that even though the forest can be dangerous, it is also a place of beauty. She is not afraid to explore it anymore and she knows that she can always find her way home.
