The Ferryman nodded to her. She sighed and relented, sitting beside her brother, looking upon the towns and villages below, watching for a moment the daily lives of the tiny people they both cared for before Life spoke once more: \"I'm dying, sister.\" Death snapped out of her day dream and looked at her brother, he did not meet her gaze, instead looking mournfully at the people below. \"But that's not-\" Death started before Life interrupted her \"Look at me. I've changed have I not?\" Death looked at her brother more closely, he was right, where he once had flowers budding across his body, there were only a few wilted stems, the right-most horn adorning his head was broken and parts of his left leg were charred. Death raised her head and met his gaze, his once glowing, amber eyes were sunken and pale.\n\nLife reached out to his sister and brushed the tear from her cheek. He turned his head slowly back towards the setting sun. \"I don't have long. I'm sorry, sister. Do not scorn them for what they are doing, we promised father that we would care for them. Some of them remember, some of them still practice what they were taught long ago; how to give back a little of what they take. Those few are what sustain me, those few and that which hasn't yet been cut, killed or burned, but it won't be long. Once I'm gone you'll have much more work to do so please don't get too stressed.\"\n\nDeath continued to look at her brother's wilted figure, she knew that she couldn't save him, not now. \"Is there anything I can do?\" She whimpered, brushing another tear from her eye. Life raised his branch-like hand and showed her two of his fingers, \"firstly, when I'm gone, I want you to bury me somewhere nice, somewhere fertile. That way I may regrow one day once the dark days have passed.\" Death nodded as she knew of such a place. \"Lastly...\" Life took her hand and squeezed, gently. \"Would you watch the sunset with me?\" Death nodded once more and lowered her hood, exposing her red eyes and flowing black hair to the setting sun. They both watched as the distant star slowly disappeared below the horizon beyond before death felt her brother's grip loosen. She lowered her head and closed her eyes, one final tear escaping and dropping off the edge of the cliff. \n\nShe looked over to her brother, his sunken eyes finally closed with a smile on his countenance. The Ferryman approached, bowing respectfully. \"My lady, shall I carry him aboard?\" Death raised her hood once more and nodded to her faithful companion, she watched as he carefully picked him up and set him down in the ferry. \"You go on\" she whispered. \"I need a moment...\" The Ferryman bowed once more and stepped into the ferry, lighting the lantern and picking up his oar. Though there was no water atop the mountain, the ferry glided through the air, gently rocking as if small waves were lapping against the sides. Death turned back towards the sunset, towards the towns and villages below and sat back down at the cliffs edge. \"That plague can wait a while longer...\"", "ups": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.98}, {"genre": "Humour", "title": "The Infinite Monkey Theorem: An Alternative Perspective", "text": " \n\n \n\nImagine you are an immortal chimp working to support your chimp family. Your chimp wife and children need the money. One day your chimp children will go to college and support you and your chimp wife when you are too old to work any longer. It's truly the perfect chimpanzee dream, just like the movies.\n\nYou work in a never ending cycle of tippity tapping away on a keyboard. You're not alone, you are surrounded by a seemingly endless supply of fellow simian laborers, all typing just the same. Work consists of pressing buttons and submitting a plethora of unreadable garbage to meet the yearly quota. Life is good, it's easy work.\n\nOne day, management decided to make better use of you and your ape compatriots. You are assigned with one task and one task only; write the entirety of Shakespearean literature. You can exit the building only when you have completed your assignment. Sounds time consuming but simple, right? Wrong. Your small chimpanzee brain can not yet process the meaning of the strange symbols on the keyboard in front of you.\n\nYou try to quit, \u201cI can't write Shakespeare!\u201d All that comes out is incoherent screeching and wailing.

No, your ape coworkers are seemingly unbothered and continue to smash their keyboards. You panic, you haven't had to exercise your brain in decades. Now they expect you to write full english sentences?\n\nInternally screaming, you type frantically and randomly across your keyboard in hopes that you may get lucky and write a legible sentence or two. You won't, at least not for another couple of eons. Only now do you survey your surroundings, desperate for a way out. The door, locked. How about the windows? Seems like you never looked up from your computer for long enough to realize there ARE no windows. Maybe the ventilation shaft? Bolted and secure. Maybe you can break the door down? Nope, the years of endless office work has shriveled your body into a husk of its former self. You can barely support the glasses you wear on your head, let alone a steel door. Looks like you're out of options.\n\nThe chimps alongside you work diligently and happily, unaware of the dire situation. You try typing, for only a bit. The constant mistakes and deletion of your hard work grinds you down. You work for hours at a time for zero gain. The end is nowhere near in sight. Only now does it truly dawn on you your situation. You sit down and cross your arms in protest. You will refuse to work until they let you see your family! Except, no one ever comes. What's one monkey refusing to work in a sea of countless others who work with no complaints?\n\nEventually, you lose all hope and spend countless decades, even centuries, doing absolutely nothing. Time truly has no meaning when you are immortal. Luckily your small ape brain is easily entertained by throwing assorted objects around the room and screeching at the top of your lungs. Even that however, gets old eventually.\n\nOne day this repetitive cycle ends. An announcement, over the intercom. \u201cChimp #72938403 has completed his work. Congratulations!\u201d You are dumbfounded. Chimp #72938403 waltzes over to the exit doors. You seize this opportunity and make a break for it. You see the outside world. You see sunlight again. Just as quickly as you gained your temporary freedom, you lose it again. You are thrown back into the endless cubicles of your workplace. Seeing a fellow monkey make his way out of this hell, it determines you. \u201cIf he can do it, I can do it!\u201d, you think. You must get to work if you ever wish to live again.

Haven\u2019t we done that kind of thing before?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ve done that in the past, but usually only to expand the radius from the Earth to the solar system when the sim becomes aware of outer space. We haven\u2019t had a sim try to break out of its solar system yet. And if we allow that in this sim, we\u2019ll have to account for it in the other sims too.

We can\u2019t afford to let them reach the barrier, but you\u2019re not suggesting turning it off? So what\u2019s the plan then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we don\u2019t have a great option. Of course, to avoid archiving them we need to get them to stop looking outward and start focusing more on what\u2019s available within the bounds of the simulation.

My sword and dagger are somewhere in the dining hall, my armor I took off next to this astoundingly comfy sofa. \n\nAnd we are so close to each other I can feel the warmth of her skin. I never knew vampires would have warm skin. I always thought \u2013 being undead and all \u2013 they would be ice-cold, just like zombies.   She told me, laughingly, as if to let me in on an intimate joke: \"Yes, that is a common misconception. We may be undead, but we drink so much blood, and that blood still circulates through our bodies, it does make sense for us to be at least somewhat warm, doesn't it?\"   I still feel awkward for asking, even though that was over an hour ago. \n\nOh, and her reasoning for this invitation is the cutest and saddest thing I've ever heard: \"It's just been so long since I had a normal conversation with someone from the living world. I miss learning about the outside. The technological advancements, the changes in social constructs, new cultural phenomenons, everything. But because of the stupid curse of a past pope, I have no chance to escape this old castle.\"     \n\"You want to know about the outside? Anything specific?\"     \n\"Oh, just in general. The last time someone talked to me normally, the world was about go up in flames due to a war with... Nazis, I believe they were called?\"     \n\"Oh, wow, that was *over 70 years ago*. You really had noone to talk to for this long?\"     \n\"Well, I can talk to animals in their language, but they don't understand half of what is going on between humans.\" \n\nFor over 3 hours I just told her about the world \u2013 about what happened in the last 80 or so years. The curiosity and fascination in her eyes and her body-language was so adorable. \n\nNow, we are talking about music and art. I told her about Progressive Rock. To someone that never heard about Rock in general, I had a hard time explaining it. The best I could come up with was \"Traditional music with hard and dirty sounds, and heavy rhythms\" \u2013 god, that is one horrible explanation.   \"I will bring something the next time I visit.\"     \n\"You want to visit *again*?\" her red eyes shine so bright I can see the dark green spots in them.   \n\"Yeah, of course! We have so much fun talking with each other, why wouldn't I come again?\"     \n\"Oh, thank you so much.\" it looks like she was about to cry, but there are no tears. \"This is so nice to hear from someone alive. It means a lot, even just the thought.\"     \n\"It's not just a thought. People are hard to come by that are actually engaging to talk to.\"   \nWith that, she throws herself into my arms and we are now just sitting there, in a deep embrace.   \n  \n\nI have the impression, love doesn't discriminate between the living and the undead.   \n  \n\n***Is There A Future?***  \n\nOver the last year, I've been spending a lot of time with Vengietta in her castle.    \nI really do like her.      \nShe knows my parents, I know her world.

They like her I think. Her very intellectual and... royal attitude is very much what my parents would want me to be as well.    \nAnd *her* friends are... fascinating, to say the least. They are very 'physical' with me, always challenging me to friendly duels. I think I have yet to have a meeting with any of them that doesn't at least turn into a short brawl with some monster.    \nAnd Mindflayers are hilarious. The ability to make everyone drunk or high without any long-term side effects is amazing.  \n\nVengietta seems so happy all the time.      \nDespite being over 1000 years old, she never lost her appreciation for the beauty in life.    \nDespite having suffered so much, being cursed to stay in this castle forever, she never lost her trust in humanity.    \nInstead she developed a strong faith in the possibility that humans and monsters can co-exist some day.    \nAnd, having gotten to know her and her friends, I now share that believe.  \n\nAnd her appreciation for any form of art is beyond anything I have ever seen. She finds beauty in everything.      \nIn the literary descriptions by S\u00fc\u00dfkind or Lovecraft just as in movies like 50/50 or \u2013 completely different \u2013 Event Horizon, or music of any kind.    \nAnd the way she dances! To say 'ethereal' doesn't even match the smallest aspects of her dance. The ability to shapeshift into crows, bats, snakes, a cat or a hound ads so many options to her movement, it is amazing to watch. Very difficult for a human to keep up though.    \n   \n\nI think I have to correct myself.  I don't 'really do like' her. I love her.  \n\nBut... it is difficult, sometimes.  There is of course the aging process.      \nAs long as she feeds on animals, she won't die or age, but I will.   \nAnd I am not sure if I want to become a vampire myself. It would of course bring a lot of advantages with it, the most important one that I can spend a long life with her.      \nBut not every vampire can control their hunger with only cattle and wild animals. If I am not strong enough to control it, I will become a problem for humans. I wouldn't want that, not at all. I don't want to endanger innocent people \u2013 or innocent monsters for that matter.  \n\nBut the worst is... I pity her. I want for her to be able to see the world herself, not just through tellings of others.    \nI could never tell her that I pity her, that seems... cruel. But it doesn't change the fact that I feel that way.  \n\nThe current pope is more open-minded and maybe he would be willing to lift the curse, so Vengietta can be free...  I think I should try that.

It started five years ago. I was having trouble adjusting to my new life, and it was then, on my way home from the third interview of the week, that I noticed it. A secret place. It lay off the side of the road just around the corner of what would later be my place of work. I noticed it in the mirror as I drove past. I was having a rough day and thought I could use the fresh air. Truthfully, I needed some time to myself to gather my thoughts. I walked over to where the trees parted and followed the dirt path to a beautiful opening. There was a creek there. It was peaceful, so I sat down. Before I knew it, an hour had past. I wasn't even sure what had happened. I thought I was just tired, so I hurried home.\n\nI later took the job, and for whatever reason, I told my wife to expect me home at six. This was unusual for me. I don't lie. But I justified this one as it seemed completely harmless. It wasn't like I was doing anything wrong. At least, not at first.\n\nFor the first year, nothing much happened, but as time went on, I began to notice a pattern. My memories of my time spent in what I now affectionately called \"my little slice of paradise\" became progressively more foggy. But I never cared much. What I did know was that I felt more like myself during that hour that I did for the other twenty-three hours of the day, and as far as I could tell, my \"me time\" made me a better man -- a better husband and a better father.\n\nBy year three, I had no memory of the hour spent in my slice of paradise. It was then that things began to get weird. I started noticing unusual searches in my search history. Unusual turned into scary. I was ashamed of myself. I felt that these searches were out of character for me, but something inside me prevented me from ever coming clean.\n\nIn the coming years, I amassed an unbearable amount of guilt. Guilt for things I had no recollection of doing. I can only describe it as a heavy weight on my shoulders. Still, no matter how hard I tried to remember -- nothing. I couldn't remember a thing. And so I kept living my life. Surely I wasn't really a bad person. I comfortably lived my life for five years, and then the day finally came.\n\n\"POLICE! HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD, SIR! ON THE GROUND!\" The officer tackled me to the ground. As I lay with my head against the dirt, I saw a body. Blood was on my hands. I began to wail.\n\nI heard my wife's voice. \"TOM! HOW COULD YOU?\"\n\nFor the duration of the ride to the station, I had a headache. It was a pain unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The lights didn't help.\n\nThe next day was overwhelming. I couldn't stop thinking about what I did and what might happen at five o'clock. I looked up at the clock and read \"four forty-nine.\" I let out a sigh and got up from where I was seated.\n\nIt was five thirty-one by the time I got back to my cell. My mind was unusually clear. Everything was clear. It was all coming back to me. Everything that I had done.\n\nNow, it must be five fifty. The feeling I have in my chest is so painful. My heart is beating so fast. I can't catch my breath. I grasp my hair in my hands and begin to pull. I lean to the wall and begin to tap my forehead against the brick. My thoughts are so loud. My hearing begins to buzz. My brain feels like it is pulsating. Thoughts of all of the terrible things I have done are spinning around my head. I pick up the pace. I repeatedly slam my head into the wall. My vision goes red. I'm screaming.\n\nI hear the guards coming. I'm being restrained. I begin to wonder where this pain is coming from and why I'm bleeding.

You try not to leave your bed, which you treat as gently as possible, because you know you\u2019re causing it pain as well.

The lounge room was empty, the front window open and the curtains blowing in the breeze.\n\nThe kitchen was silent also. Dishes didn\u2019t clutter the bench and a freshly baked cake sat on the bench, still cooling. I took a drink from the fridge, cracking it open and letting the cool liquid roll down my throat.\n\nThe back deck was filled with nothing but sunshine.

The computers were off, the windows and curtains closed. All of the books that I had left sprawled over my desk were put away on the shelves. I ran my fingers over the spines. I was lucky to have someone who cared so much about how our home looked. \n\nBut where was that special someone?

I so rarely caught them in bed while the sun was still up. Even though I would really love to have a shower before I crawled in with them, I didn\u2019t want to miss this chance.\n\nSilently, I eased open the door to the bedroom. There, with the blankets tucked under their chin, was my partner. I couldn\u2019t help the smile that came to my face as I stalked towards them, shedding my clothes with as little noise as possible.\n\nTheir face was peaceful, unmarred with the small frown they often wore when they were awake. It made them look much younger. I lifted the blanket on my side of the bed and slipped into the cool sheets.\n\nMy arm wrapped around their waist and I pressed a kiss to their forehead.

I mean babies between the mystical races of the realms often get left behind, turned over to Nowhere. But I had heard her cry and when I saw her---those big black eyes filled with the gleams of nebulas yet born---I couldn\u2019t help but be moved. So yes, I, Mother of Realms and All Creation, adopted her without knowing the full extent of her parentage.\n\nFor decades, that was fine. I taught her about conjuring magic and realm exploration. Showed her all the millions of worlds that I designed. She even took to designing a few herself! Then, about her sixtieth, the kidnappings started. She was princess of the Nether where we lived, a place with portals to all the realms I birthed, so naturally, unscrupulous sentience were tempted to kidnap her. There\u2019d been dragons, orcs, robots, demons, and angels, to name a few that succeeded.\n\nI was running out of bodyguards for her as soon as I made them.

I never needed another entity for more than companionship and friendship, which is probably why I never noticed little Daisy unconsciously sending out all those magical luring desires across the multiverse. My fierce asexuality made me blind to how she\u2019s come into deity-hood  pulsing with the yearning of a thousand lifetimes.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t her fault, it never was, but I have no idea how to help her.\n\nHer power will only grow in the next two years before her centennial.

Maybe I should leave the gender prediction to the doctors. Speaking of doctors at my most recent appointment they said my memory was better than anticipated. The look of pride on Margrets face was unmistakable. She told the doctor all about how she was constantly giving me memory quizzes. She even insists we watch jeopardy every night.

He goes there every morning now that he knows her schedule, even though it is not on his way to work. She normally wears a pair of yoga pants that fit so well that they become her second skin. She greets him with a smile, which he seldom receives from his wife at home. Every morning since their second child was born, she has resembled a cross between Gollum and Jabba the Hutt rather than the woman he married. This morning, as he gets his coffee, he thinks to himself, \n\n\"If I could only have one night with this gift from God, that's all I'd need.\" \n\nThe scenario is entirely in his head; in truth, Anita is so exhausted most mornings that she operates on autopilot, hardly seeing the customers who come in. She is programmed to take orders, make coffee, and collect money like a robot. But that really doesn't matter because he's obsessed. In his mind, he had imagined them falling in love while sharing a macchiato and making passionate love on the coffee shop floor while the other customers look on. His order has been completed, and she calls out his name, \"Theo.\" And, despite the fact that she misspells his name and the coffee tastes like burnt toast, he tries to slip a dollar into the tip jar. For the 20th time in a row, she misses the tip, and he heads to work.\n\nAnita Rosales attends City College at night and looks forward to her Psychology 101 class with Professor Leroy Quinn. The way he says the term psychodynamic raises the temperature in the room by 20 degrees, forcing Anita to unbutton her blouse. She is aware that he is married, but that doesn't matter; all she wants is for him to get to know the real her, and he would leave his wife and make love to her in his office, which is actually a converted janitor closet, but she doesn't know this. She can tell he works out because of the definition of his muscles through his ordinary polo shirt, with biceps so taut that she begins to worry about the fabric of his sleeve being able to contain all that power. He hands back the exams when the lecture ends that night. Anita glances down and notices her \"C-.\" She runs her finger over the grade; his pen touched this page; she'll fantasize about him again tonight, making love while he grades papers.\n\nLeroy Quinn had no desire to be a psychology professor. He had always had a sense of adventure and only took the job till he had enough money to travel the world. His love of adventure got him in trouble during his first year of teaching when he slept with one of his students. She was a teenager, only 18 years old. The temptation to prove it was more than a fling compelled them to marry a year later. Things have changed five years later, and this formerly sane, youthful taboo has started to reveal her true nature. When Leroy does something she doesn't like, she transforms into a five-foot-tall version of Sam Kinison and Lizzie Borden. Leroy can't wait to get to the gym and work off all his stress as he exits class that night. He's especially excited to see Andrew Peralta, the gym employee at the front desk. He's bought 57 protein bars, 13 protein drinks, and four t-shirts with the gym logo on them in the previous two months; the sad part is, he doesn't even like the protein bars, and the t-shirts look like they were drawn by a five-year-old unsupervised. These brief interactions, on the other hand, provide him with the opportunity to spend a few minutes with Andrew. After a few conversations, he still doesn't know anything but his first and last name. From Leroy's perspective, he is clever, intellectual, and completely swept him off his feet. Andrew will one day take him in his arms and carry him around the gym like Richard Gere in Officer and a Gentleman. They'll both quit their jobs and spend their days making love on the Caribbean's sandy beaches. Unfortunately, despite Leroy telling Andrew his name several times, Andrew still has no idea who he is. He smiles, nods, hands him a towel, and waits out the rest of his shift so he can finally leave. Leroy walks into the gym tonight, and Andrew hands him a towel. Leroy points to a protein bar and tries to strike up a conversation; \"have a good one, buddy,\" Andrew says, blanking on the name.\n\nIn college, Andrew Peralta met the woman of his dreams, Alicia Maynard. They quickly became friends, but unfortunately for Andrew, they've been friends for the entirety of their time together; friend-zoned by the love of his life. Despite several tries, he has failed at every point to move the relationship ahead. Andrew fantasizes about them fleeing to Europe and making love on trains. It's always trains for some reason; he thinks it has something to do with the rhythm of the tracks; I guess don't knock it till you try it. Andrew and Alicia go to bars, hang out with large groups of friends, and speak all the time. The bottom line is that Alicia simply does not feel the same way about Andrew. She prefers a mature man with responsibilities, as well as a family man that is loyal and loving. Andrew is simply too immature, has no regard for the future, and constantly wears those hideous gym t-shirts.\n\nAlicia Maynard is employed by a small financial firm. Leo Walker, one of her coworkers, brought his kids in one afternoon after they got out of school early for a half-day. She observed what a fantastic father Leo was and fell in love with him right away. Alicia dreamt about them making love all over the office, despite the fact that he was married. In the mailroom, the elevator, and on the copy machine. In one such scenario, a company-wide memo served as foreplay for their sexual rendezvous.

When someone was ready to move onto the afterlife Death was able to hear them and those around them, like a bell rung during a still night and he would come to claim them. Death loved traveling the world and deeply enjoyed that his work took him to so many new and exciting places every day.\n\nOne day Death heard a family speaking about their son who had been involved in a terrible accident. They hoped for his recovery, but when Death visited the man in the hospital Death knew it was the man\u2019s time. Death did his duty and placed a single finger upon the man\u2019s heart, ending his life. Death began to leave, but as he turned he heard the man\u2019s family begin to curse and swear at Death. Their faces swelled red with grief and rage, and their voices howled at Death for what he had done. Death could not understand. It was not his fault the man had died, it had simply been his time. \n\nDeath continued his work, but he began to notice more people blaming him everywhere he went. As he claimed drunk drivers, frozen hikers, and crushed bikers he heard more and more people blaming him. Those close to the recently deceased continued to curse Death for what he had done and soon despair began to grow inside of Death.\n\nEven though he could still hear countless people who were ready to be claimed, Death stopped visiting anyone. He could not bear any more blame. Before long, no one was speaking ill of Death, for no one had died. But Death was still not happy. All Death could hear now was people thanking Death for sparing their loved ones, but without his work Death wandered aimlessly, unsure of where to go or what he should see. His despair only grew as he meandered without purpose.\n\nThen, amidst all the people praising Death for his mercy, Death heard a single voice that sounded different from the others. This voice was not asking for mercy or to be ignored, instead the voice was calling to Death, begging him to visit.\n\nIntrigued, Death obeyed the voice and followed its source. He found an old man, bent from age and folded by wrinkles laying in his bed. Around the man\u2019s room Death could see pictures of the man as he looked when he was younger. Death saw photos of the man graduating schools, catching fish, getting married, playing sports, holding a newborn child. The man had lived a long life full of rich memories. Almost all the photographs of the man also included a woman who Death could see grow old alongside the man. Death looked around for the woman but could not see her anywhere in the room. It was then that Death recognized the woman. He had claimed her some years ago, in this very room.\n\nThe old man spoke again, asking for Death\u2019s touch. Death took the man\u2019s hand in his own, and  as the man passed on Death heard a soft whisper of thanks pass from his dry lips.\n\nDeath resumed his work, but every now and then he ignored a call if there were not enough photographs.", "ups": 24, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Action &amp; Adventure", "title": "Journals", "text": "Neil fired the rifle.

Tall and lanky, his body was a far cry from what it would have been had he grown up with the abundance of food that was available before The Fall. \n \nA storm arrived as they ate.

Look!\u201d Henry pointed to the highway down the hill in front of them. It was clogged with dead and rusted cars. Beyond it, rows of houses sprawled into suburbia.\n \nThe neighbourhood was almost exactly as Neil remembered it, except that the streets and sidewalks were cracked and covered with shrubbery. He stopped in front of their old house, where they had intended to raise their family. This was supposed to be where Henry grew up. \n \n\u201cThis is it?\u201d Henry asked as he approached the front door. He was just a baby when they left. Neil winced as he followed Henry. \n \nInside, the house was ransacked. Neil stopped just in front of the staircase. A picture lay broken at his feet. He picked it up.Julia smiled back at him. She was holding baby Henry. \n \n\u201cIs that her?\u201d \n \nNeil turned around to see Henry looking at him. \u201cYeah.\u201d \n \nHenry walked over and took the picture from his Dad. \u201cCan I keep it?\u201d\n \nBefore Neil could answer, loud yelling outside echoed through the empty neighbourhood. \u201cUpstairs,\u201d Neil whispered. \u201cHurry!\u201d \n \nAt the top of the stairs, Neil darted into the master bedroom. He ripped old items off the closet shelves and found the shoebox tucked against the wall. He took it out and opened it. \n \nAll of Julia\u2019s journals were there. They detailed every aspect of her life, including their marriage and their early days with Henry. Julia died so early into The Fall that Henry never knew her. It was the one thing Neil wanted to give him. Now he could. \n \nSuddenly, the voices from outside were much closer. Downstairs, the front door was kicked in. Neil froze and listened to the muffled voices. The first one swore that he saw the people come into the house. The other replied that they\u2019d better search the place. \n \nAs they moved around downstairs, Neil very quietly crawled down the front hall. His leg dragged along behind him, a nasty reminder that he couldn\u2019t run away. He found Henry in the nursery.\n \nThe voices were at the bottom of the stairs now and making their way up. Neil went into the nursery with Henry and waited just to the side of the open doorway. He held the rifle up. \n \nThe footsteps made their way down the hall towards them and stopped just outside of the door. Neil held his breath, praying the man would just go away. But nobody just goes away. Not in this world. \n \nEveryone in the house was startled when the bird hit the window, but Neil was the first to act. He jumped out and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. It was jammed. Before Neil could try again, the man swiped the rifle out of his hands. It landed in the centre of the room. Neil blocked his son from the man in front of him. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t want any trouble,\u201d Neil said. \u201cPlease.\u201d \n \nThe man grabbed Neil by the back of the neck and dragged him to the hallway. \u201cHey Jack!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI got him! He\u2019s got a little kid with--\u201d\n \nThe gunshot was deafening. The man\u2019s grip around Neil\u2019s neck loosened as he fell to the ground. Henry stood in the open doorway of the nursery, still pointing the rifle at the now dead man. \n \nJack ran out of the master bedroom at the sound of the gunshot. He made for Henry, but Neil stood in front of him. He easily shoved Neil out of the way. Henry pulled the trigger again, but again it didn\u2019t fire. \n \nThe man charged towards Henry, but Henry pushed the nozzle of the gun into the man\u2019s belly. Then, he ran forward with all of his strength. They both stumbled backwards, towards the stairs, and went over the top step. \n \n\u201cNo!\u201d Neil pulled himself onto his hands and knees and dragged himself to the top of the stairs. Two motionless bodies lay at the bottom. \u201cHenry!\u201d \n \nThe little body at the bottom of the stairs rolled over. Henry smiled at his father. \n \nAs they packed their bags to get back onto the road, Neil gave the journals to Henry. \n \n\u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, I don\u2019t need a bunch of books to tell me that Mom loved me. I know she did. And I know you do too.\u201d \n \nNeil smiled. This kid was wise beyond his age. Then again, he had to be to survive in this world.

It felt like I was on fire as if each atom in my body was being ripped apart. Then everything went black. \n\nIt always started with a falling sensation. Then a rainbow of colors formed into a vibrant tunnel as I felt my consciousness reform. At the bottom of the tunnel, I could see a small cot in a windowless metal room with my own sleeping body laying on top of it. I fell towards it, my senses returning one by one, becoming fully formed once I reached the bottom of the tunnel and I watched as I slammed into my sleeping body.

The walls were covered in computer monitors, weapons and equipment, all things we had prepped for the coming mission. The one that had gone wrong, 24 hours from now. I looked up to see Clarissa, she looked at me, then she looked above me to look at the colored light above my head, and saw it was yellow, meaning the mission had gone bad, and she had to trigger a reset. Clarissa knew what the light meant, and she knew how much the process hurt. Before I could speak, she ran over to me and gave me a tight embrace. Whenever this happened, she always said the same thing to me.  \n\u201cThank you, and hopefully you never have to again.\u201d It was always the same sequence of words before and after every reset. Whether she knew it or not, I would probably never know, but it was the point of consistency in my weird and ever changing timeline.\n\nI sighed, before approaching the planning table.

A tale that I never dare utter out loud. Even now, 15 years later, I start shaking at the bare thought of what had happened. However, I can not remain silent forever, and I need my voice to be heard, for the sake of younger me.\r\n\r\nI remember it being a cold, bitter night, as expected from the merciless winter in the desolate state of California. I had just arrived at my local convenience store, for my night shift, and I distinctively recall having a gut wrenching feeling almost as if something totally unexpected was about to occur. The air felt thick, and I could smell the damp earth after a long winter rain and I took it all in, slowly breathing, as if it was going to be my last time smelling it. I\u2019m known for being a rational person, and for that reason alone, I ignored said feeling. In that dark, silent night, only my thoughts were keeping me company. Working from 2a.m-8a.m was usually uneventful, and I only needed to interact with the occasional smoker or drunkard. After dropping out of college, I was doing my best balancing work as a babysitter in the evenings and being a convenience store clerk at dawn. I quite cherished that job, as the pay was generous and the workload was light, despite the shady owner, Jeff. An old guy who has probably seen too much in his lifetime. I\u2019ve heard rumours regarding him as a pedophile and a pervert who has supposedly taken advantage of dozens of middle-school girls and female part-timers. However, I have yet to see evidence of these claims first-hand and I was satisfied with how things were going. The buzzing from the artificial ceiling lights was greatly contributing to my pulsating headache. The door bell jingled a lovely melody and a cold breeze hugged me, forcibly pulling me out of my meaningless thoughts. The first customer of the night walked in and paid for an overpriced pack of Marlboro. The interaction was brief and straightforward, as expected. I will never understand the concept of smoking. I honestly don\u2019t see the appeal of spending money for the purpose of shortening my life expectancy, not as if its any of my business. Sighing a long breath, I looked out of the window to take in the very familiar, yet comforting sight of the empty streets.\r\n\r\nI directed my gaze towards a parked car that I\u2019ve failed to notice up until now. I guessed it was a sixth generation Honda Civic, although the limited amount of light outside made it hard to tell. The small parking area in front of the store was always empty at that time of the day, so to me, that was unusual. I observed the car for a couple of minutes, waiting for something to happen. Slowly growing impatient, I grabbed my SwissTech keychain (not the prettiest out there, but definitely the most useful in terms of keeping me safe) and I headed outside, walking in a straight line towards the suspicious car. I\u2019m still not sure what I was expecting, but I thought that whatever would happen will most definitely quench my thirst of curiosity. Only a few inches away from the intriguing vehicle, I noticed that it is empty, and that the trunk is slightly open. Despite fully knowing that I am not allowed to touch somebody else\u2019s property, I jerked the trunk open. I immediately knew I had just made a terrible mistake. A mistake that will never be undone. My eyes widened in pure terror and my heart was a train pounding down the tracks. I broke out in a cold sweat, and I could not take my vision away from the tied down stranger in front of me. Their casual clothes were drenched with blood, and they did not move a single inch. I did not want to assume the worst, but frankly, I was definitely looking at nothing other than a fresh corpse. I winced, feeling sick and pained and winded all at once. I could not breath. My mind was foggy. Leave. I knew I had to leave. Before I even had the chance to process what I had just witnessed, rushed footsteps combined with the freezing rain to produce music.

I started doing drugs with my older brother when I was 13. He had a good hookup for hash (I think he was doing a small time dealer/metal head who worked at the local gas station). I didn\u2019t even smoke pot for a few months, only hash. \n\n\nBy eighth grade, a few kids we hung with were smoking crack, including my weed dealer. He sold me dusted weed, said it was fun. I didn\u2019t find it fun. \n\n\nWe lived in a real city and were upper middle class or richer. Our parents sent us to good schools, but it was the eighties. When you went for a smoke outside the school, you crunched crack vials under you feet. \n\nI drank, smoked a lot of weed, stole money from my parents and got codeine pills and perks whenever I could. Malt liquor and Tylenol 3 was my twist. At recess we sniffed a liquid called rush they sold in a local record store. You learned to sit down before you sniffed it, because most of the time it would make you fall flat.\n\n\n\nSo, around 16 I had a best friend. Call her Meg. We both liked to get messed up in the same way. And she slept with lots of my friends, but me and her were just cool. You know when you meet someone who uses like you do and you just click? Like you ride a tandem bicycle called drugs. That was me and her. Plus, her mom was in and out of jail for fraud so she wasn\u2019t really concerned if we smelled like weed. Their dog peed on the carpet and nobody ever cleaned it up. You just stayed away from that side of the living room. \n\n\n\nMeg was dating my friend \u201cPaul\u201d. Paul was a wrestler, loved The Who and would generally take two pulls and say \u201cI\u2019m good!\u201d\n\nHis dad had him start wrestling at age five. His neck was wider than his head and he had a cauliflower ear.\n\n\nSo Meg said that this other guy, \u201cPhil\u201d has a big score. Phil was a cool kid from the magnet art school. He had a beard when we were in 8th grade and talked like he owned a gallery in Chelsea. He managed a band.\n\n\n\nAnyway, we get to Phils house and he unwraps the stuff from tin foil. Looks like hash but lighter brown than the really dark hash I grew up on. He said it was opium. We smoked it from a bong if I remember correctly. \n\n\nHere is what I remember. Phil\u2019s room was painted black and had a high ceiling. He had a table and chairs, upright, attached to the ceiling. So when you looked up it was like you were five feet underground. He was artsy like that.\n\n\nI smoked, and from the very back of my skull, slowly forward to my forehead, pain I never realized had always been there, disappeared. It was like, there had not been pain, but now in this total absence of pain, I realized what a searing crown of barbed wire I had worn all my life. I couldn\u2019t believe I never got to do this before, this was how god intended me to feel always and forever.\n\n\nI laid on the floor, so did Phil and Meg. We all looked up at the table we were under. \n\n\nPaul hadn\u2019t smoked, \u201cI\u2019m good\u201d, and with a gennny cream ale in one hand, he lightly palmed Meg\u2019s boob in the other. I made fun of Paul, but honestly, I was in love with Meg and her boobs.\n\n\nI don\u2019t remember how long the high lasted, but not super long. I scraped the screen and resmoked the resin to little effect. Phil said the opium was a gift and he could not get more. \n\n\nI called every person I knew for a week looking for some but never found any. \n\n\nI wound up getting clean and sober at 17 and have been ever since. Honestly, looking back I can\u2019t even say why, other than that I knew I would die from it all one day. Which is, in itself, ironic. Try going through college in aa. Not a lot of fun. \n\n\nI\u2019m basically a business guy of decent success these days with treatment resistant depression. I realized I have been thinking about killing myself since age 8, hence, the irony. Heavy, old fashioned antidepressants from before anything you have heard of work best for me. Because of them I only sleep an hour a day and if I eat the wrong thing I could give myself a stroke. \n\nI\u2019m still here, which is kind of a shock. I\u2019m even happy now and then, and I have no idea what to do with that.\n\n\nPhil went to art college in la. He filmed porn for a few years until he had some shows and now is a tenured art professor at a big state school. \n\n\nI ran into Paul at age 30. He had disappeared and looked like he had been on a desert island. Gone bald, long beard, dirty clothes. We hung out twice and caught up. He told me some crazy stories that involved fights, hookers whispering through brick walls and calming himself down by smoking crack. Whenever he tried to stop smoking crack someone would blow crack smoke under his door until the smell of it filled his apartment and he had to smoke more. Turns out he was/is schizophrenic. \n\n\nMeg went off to college and never came home for another ten years. She was always smart, and wound up with a phd in history and a rotten heroin addiction. She went through rehab eight times. A friend bumped into her in front of a methadone clinic in our city when we were about 35. Finally, she poured gasoline on herself and her dog and that was that. \n\n\nThat shit will always follow me like Paul\u2019s crack smoke blowers, I can\u2019t get away no matter how hard I try. Would I have been her? Should I have been her? \n\n\n\nI did feel that brain cleansing high one other time. My sophomore year in college, the depression (then untreated) was raging and I started making an honest, logical plan of exactly how to kill myself the next day. Steps and details.\n\n\n\nI jerked off so I could get to sleep and had a dream. It seemed inconsequential at first, I was in a warehouse next to the ocean and the sun was low in the sky. The wall between me and the ocean crumbled away and the light of the sun became incredible. Then the light lifted me off my feet, and as it pulled me towards it, that same pain rolled away, from the back of my head forward. \n\n\nEuphoria.

And I don\u2019t mean that in the moral sense or anything. I am confident there are folks who would call me pure evil and others who would say I am sent from heaven. Perspectives being what they are and such.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean that in a superlative way either. I am not one of those conceited sorcerers who gives myself an arbitrary descriptor and I am not in the public eye enough to have earned one\u2026. yet.  \n\nI simply mean that I am a fairly capable witch. Sufficiently skillful. Absolutely adept. Practically perfect, even. Or at least, I thought I was until this most recent premonition. It makes absolutely no sense to me, which is not to say that it makes no sense at all, perspectives again. And that is where you come in.  \n\nYou see, a lot of folks have always thought that familiars were just a witch\u2019s way of not being human for a bit. But unfortunately for you, and honestly also for me, that isn\u2019t the case. I can\u2019t just turn into an animal. I have to have an animal to turn into.   \n\nOh, don\u2019t do that cute chirping meow at me. I know you can understand me. Which is honestly one of the reasons why I picked you in the first place. I am not taking over your body so much as merging your consciousness with my own. You won\u2019t get to be in charge anymore but you will get to experience life as a human a bit, from the backseat of my brain, at least.  \n\nAnd for the first few transformations, I will be relying on you to essentially teach me how to be a cat. *Because a cat\u2019s the only cat\u2026.* \n\nSorry, where was I? Yes, the transformation. *TransFURmation.*  \n\nThere is a reason most of us pick your kind. I knew of a wizard who once picked a dog as his familiar. Not a wolf or a respectable working breed, but a little toy mutt he had found. He grew to love the teeny guy and thought he shared a certain connection with him. Didn\u2019t end well. Turns out, most mutts\u2019 inner monologue is just incessant barking. Poor wizard went mad within days.  \n\nBats are a popular one too. But that is simply because they communicate at high frequencies even in their own head, or so the theories go. They are an essentially silent partner in the whole gig. Except those giant bats like the flying foxes - very chatty guys. However, those also make a decent choice because they have adorable Aussie accidents and generally don\u2019t give a flying fox about anything, or so I\u2019ve been told.  \n\nBut felines have always been a standard favorite. \u201cWhy,\u201d you might ask? Well, it\u2019s simple, albeit odd. You are Death\u2019s favorite animal for whatever reason. I don\u2019t know if its your attitudes, your cute faces, or what, but he just really loves you guys. So much so, that he enjoys saying hi often enough to give you nine lives. I am fairly certain you haven\u2019t used any up and this will only cost you one.    \n\nAnd in costing you that one life, Death will come to explain it all to you. And when he does, and this is very important, you must ask him a simple question.   \n\nYou see, I am completely at a loss as to what this premonition means, but the visions are coming more and more frequently and end with the complete destruction of our world. You can see how that is a big deal, given that I rather enjoy living and I enjoy living on this particular planet.  \n\nThere is a rumor that Yermik the Beautiful (and before you ask, yes she did give that name to herself and yes, she was hideously ugly) wrote an exhaustive list of premonitions aspects and their respective meanings.   \n\nI need you to ask Death where Yermik\u2019s Tome is currently. Since he is taking one of your lives, I won\u2019t be there to speak to him directly, so I will be relying on you.  \n\nKeep in mind that you have nine lives, less if you decide to piss off Death, and mine are not tied to yours. So, while I hate to start our relationship off on threats, it is imperative that you understand I can break this link and redo it. Each time costing you a life, each time requiring you to ask the question.  \n\nI would much rather our relationship be built on trust, and the fact that I am more than willing to eat tuna for a week if you do me this small kindness.  \n\nSo, what do you say?

Now she simply sat still next to the casket, looking numb and broken. All I could do was watch. She didn\u2019t feel like my mother anymore, as if her soul had left with him and she left me with her shell. She always loved him so dearly.\n\nI heaved myself to the restroom, leaving behind my mother and the rest of the funeral behind me for a brief moment.

It didn\u2019t hurt, it was just uncomfortable. I stared deeper into my reflection, I looked blank. I felt blank. All I could do was stare like an idiot. Was grief always like this? I watched as my reflection opened its mouth, \u201cDo you blame yourself?\u201d The words were as light as the wind, but reverberated in my ears.\n\n\"What?\" I mutter, disturbed. It was a face that looked so much like me, a voice that sounded so much like me, but it just wasn't me. I stared at the mirror, whatever that thing was, it wasn't simply my reflection anymore. It stared at me expectantly, urging me to answer its question. Was I going insane? Is this psychosis? Or are ghosts real?\n\n\"Do you blame yourself?\" The entity in the mirror repeated. There was no malicious intent in its voice, or maybe I was just oblivious.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d I answer. Maybe this is a dumb decision, this always how people die in the movies but I didn\u2019t care. \u201cI really do.\u201d I tear my eyes away from the mirror and stare at the sink, the uncomfortable feeling in my chest magnifying. I look back at the mirror and whatever was there is gone, my own eyes stare back at me.

He was still wearing that yellow shirt, contrasting from the black swarm of funeral attendees.\n\nHe smiled before grabbing my hand and leading me back to everyone, \u201cCome on, the prayers are starting soon. Mom\u2019s looking for you.\u201d I walked behind him, like a duckling following their mother. All I could do was stare at the back of his head, only then did the uncomfort morph into pain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I muttered as we walked.

Not that you usually notice your arm hairs, but this one was tough to miss. It was thicker than any of your other ones, and darker too. You give it a little tug and find it\u2019s longer than you thought. You pull it a good four, five inches and there\u2019s still more hair coming out. You take some scissors and cut it, or at least try. It\u2019s a lot tougher than you thought: your scissors are ruined and the hair is still there. You give it another pull, just to see if there\u2019s more, and there is. You take it about two feet before you stop, wondering if it ever ends. It never does. It doesn\u2019t hurt when you pull it, though it does feel weird. You poke and prod the area around the hair, thinking something is maybe under your skin, but you feel nothing.   \n\nYou go to your parents who, in the course of their investigation, pull the hair another three feet, then conclude you should see a doctor. The doctor, after pulling the hair another foot, tries to x-ray your arm, but the machine breaks as soon as it\u2019s turned on. They try again with another machine and that breaks too. The doctor tries cutting the hair, using a scalpel, an electric saw, a paper cutter, and even an antique Japanese knife a patient had on him. Nothing works. So they try surgery.   \n\nYou find this very scary and just want to go home and not think about this gross hair that\u2019s coming out of your arm (and it is quite gross\u2013you didn\u2019t realize it at first, but now that there\u2019s enough of it you realize it smells, very faintly, of bad BO.) Still, your parents agree, and you\u2019re given something that makes you very sleepy. When you wake up, there\u2019s a bandage on your arm and a doctor beside your bed, who says that they could not remove the hair. They tried digging it out by its root, but all they managed to do was break several scalpels. They also couldn\u2019t find any reason why this one hair suddenly got so long, strong, and gross. They say the only way to really get rid of the hair would be to remove the arm. That makes both you and your parents very upset.   \n\nSo, your family tries other things. They try a blowtorch. They try a laser. They try a saw used to cut diamonds. Nothing works. Sometimes, like with the blowtorch, you only get hurt, because you find out the hair conducts heat very well. This goes on for weeks. The hair gets extremely long in the meantime. You do your best to be careful but sometimes you\u2019re walking and it gets snagged on something and you don\u2019t notice for a while until you look back and see you\u2019ve added another ten feet or so. Or sometimes, in your sleep, it gets caught on your pillow and as you roll around in bed the hair gets longer with each movement of your arm. One time, the worst time, you got into a car and didn\u2019t realize your hair had gotten wrapped around a tree branch and it took a few miles before you realized what had happened. \n\nYou might have been able to tie it up before, when it was smaller, to keep these sort of things from happening, but now it has gotten much too large to manage. You have to coil it up like a garden hose to walk around, and it\u2019s heavy and it\u2019s stinky and it\u2019s gross. So, eventually, you tell your parents that you just want them to chop off your arm. You\u2019ve had enough.   \n\nYour parents take you to the doctor\u2019s again and, within a day, your arm is off. You\u2019re sad\u2013you and that arm had a lot of good memories\u2013but you\u2019re glad at least you don\u2019t have to trail that hair anymore. A while later they take off your bandages and see how you\u2019re healing. Sticking out of the stump, where your arm used to be, is another hair.

Amazingly, both were absolutely instrumental in the temporary recovery of my shop. I placed the train set in my front window and multiple parents came in and purchased something simply because their children wanted a closer look at it.

The experiment is actually pretty interesting, though. According to the papers, the evolution of the dominant species was manipulated by fungus to spread their own spores.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs if. So they\u2019re like high-functioning carrier bees?\u201d\n\n\u201cKind of. Except their functionality is off the charts. They\u2019ve developed the bulk of their technology by utilising the thermodynamics of atoms. Nothing new there. But they\u2019ve taken it to the extreme. Imagine bipedal apes, essentially smashing things together until something works, but have still managed to actually leave their planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo shit. That\u2019s a shame. Corporate usually pays extra for advanced conscious beings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. Says here psychologists are studying them too. They\u2019re not technically conscious. They just think they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait. Does thinking you\u2019re conscious not make you conscious?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they say. They\u2019re like little self-aware robots, operating under the false assumption that they are able to act rationally. They believe they have free will, and yet every decision they make is completely deterministic and predictable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how do we know that our decisions aren\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery funny. Anyway, I just thought it was worth noting. What do you want to do about it, then? Move on, or shall we pull one over on \u2018em?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a big bonus we\u2019d be missing out on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. They are quite violent. I\u2019m sure they could be convinced to war with each other, given a little nudge.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how might we do that? \u201d\n\n\u201cSow discord between them. They already have an advanced communications system, so that makes the job much easier. They call it the internet. It melds all their minds together to form a cohesive network, so if we tap into that we can make them think whatever we want.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould the research corporations find out?\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the records, they only visit every 5,000 years or so. Last time they built pyramids - concealed monitoring devices, I think - so the planet\u2019s absence will likely go unnoticed for a while. We\u2019d be long gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect. Sounds like you\u2019ve done this before.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah. Why\u2019d you think I was 5th in the employee rankings last year? For my honesty and integrity? All Corporate care about are the numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa! You\u2019re not wrong. I\u2019ll let you take the lead then, as you clearly know what you\u2019re doing. How\u2019d you wanna start off?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll spread disinformation. Create an ideological battle, and force them to choose sides through social pressure. They\u2019ll be at each other like frenzied rabbits. In a few decades only dust will remain. We\u2019ll pick up the loot, along with a fat check at the end of the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen to that, brother.\u201d", "ups": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.93}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "Another Day", "text": "Paula Johnson gets up at 5 am, jumps in the shower, slips on her stockings, steps into her shoes, digs in the pocket of her raincoat, and walks out the door into the rain. She worked as a waitress at the English Muffin, a breakfast restaurant she has worked at since it first opened a hundred years ago.\n\nIt's just another day for Paula Johnson, who is trapped in a time loop; time passes around her while she remains the same age and in the same job. Everyone around her goes about their daily lives, either leaving for better opportunities or dying. When the clock strikes, 5 am, everyone who had met Paula Johnson the day before forgets about her.\n\nHer first day at the English Muffin sparked the phenomenon. When she arrived for her second day, everyone acted as if they were meeting her for the first time. This has been her reality ever since. She's seen ownership change hands, the restaurant modernized, and longtime customers pass away and are replaced by new ones.\n\nThis morning, Paula walks into the restaurant, checks in on the computer, and walks into the manager's office.\n\n\"Oh, you're the new waitress, Paula, right? I'm Bob, the manager.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to start at the counter?\"\n\n\"Sure, Angelica has been running around all morning; I'm sure she'd appreciate your help.\"\n\nPaula grabs an apron and approaches Angelica, who is struggling to make coffee.\n\n\"I loathe this stupid machine,\" Angelica says as she aggressively presses switches with little effect.\n\n\"There is a trick: you need to wait three seconds before flipping the brew switch. Bob is aware of it but has yet to have it serviced.\" Paula says as she flips the brew switch at the right moment, and the coffee starts to percolate.\n\n\"Oh my God, I'm so glad you're here; that dumb thing has been driving me crazy all morning.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, it'll be a good day; tipping is generally higher when it's raining. Is it okay if I take the counter?\"\n\n\"Of course, do you want me to go over the menu?\"\n\n\"I've worked in places like this before; let me know if there's anything else I can do.\"\n\nPaula walks up to Mr. Innes, who has been a regular at the \n\nEnglish Muffin for the past eight years.\n\n\"Has Angelica put your bran muffin and home fries in yet?\"\n\n\"How did you know that's what I always get?\"\n\n\"Word travels quickly, Mr. Innes; I'll have that up for you as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"I can see you're going to be one to watch; your future looks promising!\"\n\nPaula smiles as an underlying sadness begins to wash over her. She overcame it and walked to the end of the counter, where a couple was waiting for their order to be taken.\n\nIt's not like Paula hasn't attempted to escape her daily life; she's tried to flee town, change careers, and even steal money, but her conscience wouldn't let her keep it. The bottom line is that the English Muffin is the only place where she can make money, support herself, and be somewhat remembered.\n\nShe's tried almost everything to break the spell in the hundred years she's been living this day-to-day existence. She tried staying awake for 24 hours, then 48 hours; she paid a woman to stay awake with her until morning; at 5 am, she forgot who Paula was and freaked out. Finally, she placed a massive billboard of herself with the words, \"I am Paula Johnson, remember me!\" Every day the billboard was up, people acted as if it were the first day, and it had little to no effect on the spell.\n\nPaula was right about this rainy Wednesday morning; it was busy; she had already made her usual amount of tips by late morning. She took a break, drank another cup of coffee, and struggled to stay awake. Bob exited his office and motioned everyone to the kitchen just as she was ready to return to work.\n\n\"I'm sorry for doing this now, but I wanted to inform everyone as soon as possible. I just got off the phone with the bank, and the English Muffin will be closing permanently.\"\n\nEveryone is stunned, but no one more so than Paula. She's almost catatonic.\n\n\"It gets worse,\" Bob continues, \"tomorrow is the last day we'll be open.\"\n\n\"The restaurant will be closed after tomorrow!\" Angelica said as she threw down a rag on a prep table in frustration.\n\n\"Okay, everyone, I'm sorry I had to upset you with this, but I didn't want you to be surprised; let's have a good rest of today and tomorrow here at the English Muffin.\"\n\n\"You're lucky this is your first day,\" Angelica said as she and Paula went back to the restaurant. \n\n\"I've given three months of my life to this job, and now I have to start all over.\"\n\nThe rest of Paula's shift is solemn, with a lot of thought on all the time she's spent here, but also worry about the future in the back of her mind.\n\nThe restaurant is about to close when a man stumbles in, drenched. He walks up to the counter, where Paula greets him with a place setting and silverware.\n\n\"Is it still raining out there?\"\n\n\"Don't worry; I think the majority of it is on me.\"\n\nAs she held out the coffee carafe, Paula laughed. She poured him a cup after he nodded.\n\nPaula found the man easy to talk to, and even though the restaurant had closed a half-hour earlier, Paula told Angelica that she would lock up.\n\nThe man asked Paula why she was sad. Maybe she was tired, maybe the news about the restaurant closing had weighed on her, but she chose to use this chance to express her emotions.\n\n\"This restaurant I've worked at for a long time is closing tomorrow, and I'm not sure what I'll do after that.\"\n\n\"You sound like I did a month ago; I had devoted my entire life to my family's business, and when it closed, I had no idea what I was going to do.\"\n\n\"When did you decide to go on with your life?\"\n\n\"I stopped making excuses; eventually, you'll spend all of your time doing things in your comfort zone, but it's beyond your comfort zone where memorable things happen.\"\n\n\"I desperately want to change, but I'm not sure I can.\"\n\n\"Here's what I'll do; tomorrow morning, I'm getting on a train to start my new life; meet me at the station, and we'll figure it out together. The train leaves at 6 am.\"\n\nThe man walked out the door, leaving a tip on the counter.\n\nPaula returns to her empty apartment, and the loneliness she has felt brings her to tears as she stares at the bare walls. She has spent the last hundred years living another day after another day and had nothing to show for it.\n\nPaula's alarm goes off at 5 am the next morning. She hops in the shower, slips into her stockings, steps into her shoes, and walks out the door. She knew it was a long shot, but she'd go to the train station in the hopes that he'd remember their conversation from yesterday.\n\nAs she approached the platform, she noticed the man from the restaurant scrolling on his phone while waiting for the train.\n\n\"Hi.\"\n\nThe man was confused; he put his phone into his pocket and looked Paula in the eyes.\n\n\"Paula! I'm so glad you could make it.\"", "ups": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.83}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "Lost and Found", "text": "The sun beat down on the Farne Islands, bringing a welcome heat for grey seals basking on the beach. Others sought to escape it: rabbits retreating into the shade of their warrens, Arctic terns diving in the beautifully cool ocean.\n\nThen there were the puffins, the most aristocratic of birds with their suit-like plumage and colourful crown of a beak; parents fished while pufflings sheltered in their burrows.\n\nOne such puffling poked his head out of one such burrow.\n\nPip stretched his wings as he stared up, watching the adults swoop and soar across the sky. His feathers brushed against the walls so he shuffled out a little further and, when no danger presented itself, a little further still.\n\nAs the tip of his tail passed the threshold Pip clambered to his feet, revelling in the feeling of the sun on his back and the wind ruffling his feathers.\n\nHis head swivelled as he hopped around, struggling to process all the new sensations. Just as he was becoming used to the world around him, a cacophony of cawing erupted around him. There was a momentary blip in the sun's warmth as a shadow passed overhead before looping back around, growing steadily larger. Pip made a frantic dash back to his burrow and dived inside just in time to escape the inquisitive beak that poked in after him.\n\nBut something wasn't right. The tunnel was the wrong shape and was missing the grass lining. Pip considered the conundrum. Could he risk going back outside? He suppressed a shudder as an image of a long, sharp beak flashed through his mind, and started shuffling further in.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" demanded a rabbit in the corner, harried by the many children that covered her.\n\n\"Sorry, I think I came in the wrong burrow. \"Is there another way out?\"\n\nHer expression softened as she registered the quiver in his voice. \"You can try that way,\" she said, shifting under the mass of young rabbits to point. \"But it's a bit of a warren down here.\"\n\n\"I'll show him,\" one of the young rabbits squeaked.\n\n\"No Kit, you're not ready to go out alone.\"\n\n\"But Muuuumm, I won't be alone. And he needs help.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" she sighed. \"But show him to the entrance and come right back. No going outside.\"\n\nKit leapt up. \"Okay Mum,\" he said, before turning towards Pip. \"Come on, it's this way.\"\n\nThey made their way through the maze of tunnels until they reached an opening. Pip paused to say thank you, but the words caught in their beak as Kit continued on.\n\n\"I thought you were meant to stop here,\" he called after the young rabbit.\n\n\"Pfft, if I always did what she said I'd never have any fun. Besides, I want to make sure you get home safely.\"\n\n\"Well, thanks,\" Pip said, hopping after him. \"I suppose --\"\n\nA screech cut him off, accompanied by an approaching shadow. He was almost back at the burrow entrance when he noticed Kit wasn't with him - his new friend was cowering in the grass, a large gull circling overhead. Without stopping to think, Pip charged across the ground beating his wings as hard as he could and soon found himself climbing into the air. But there was no time to enjoy his first flight; he had to help Kit.\n\nHe dived towards the gull, pulling away at the last second. On the next attempt his feet brushed the wings of the monstrous bird but still it ignored him. Despair was starting to creep in when two other puffins joined the fray. One of them flung their beakful of sandeels over the gull while the other flew underneath to block the view of the young rabbit. The rain of food proved enough of a distraction as the gull chased the falling fish, allowing the three puffins to glide down to the ground in relative safety.\n\nPip landed next to Kit and gently nudged him with his beak. \"It's safe. You should probably hurry home.\"\n\nKit's eyes darted around as he nodded at Pip before racing away. Pip allowed himself a small chuckle, it would be a while before Kit ignored his mother again.\n\nAs he turned his attention to his saviours, joy filled his heart. \"Mama! Papa!\"\n\n\"You gave us quite a fright young man!\" his father scolded, eyes boring into Pip.\n\nHis mother hopped towards him, pushing her head gently into his. \"Yes, but did you see that stupendous first flight?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, very good. Even if it did lose us our dinner. Now what do you say we go home? I've had enough excitement for one day.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" Pip agreed, feeling the truth of the words in his chest as they made their way to the *correct* burrow entrance.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis story was written for the WP Hub's Secret Santa Story Exchange.

What if it goes wrong and I\u2019ll get stuck in between somewhere?\u201d\n\nThe nurse looked down at the timid boy with a heartening smile. \u201cYour mother\u2019s right, Joey. You don\u2019t have to be afraid of anything. These days, we teleport ten billion people a day all over the world!\u201d\n\nBut Joey didn\u2019t care, how many people had already done it. It was the same as with getting your cancer \u201cvaccination\u201d. Everybody had to do it at one point, but the first time still was frightening.\n\n\u201cGet out the way!\u201d, another boy of similar age as Jimmy proclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ll go first and show you how it\u2019s done.\u201d With a smug face, the kid jumped into the colourful telepod and began typing in his dad\u2019s address.\n\n\u201cMiles, wait!\u201d, a young woman called, as she was pushing through the waiting line past Joey. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to wish your mother goodbye?\u201d \u2013 \u201cUuurghs\u201d, Miles returned with a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be until the evening, Mom.

As Mile\u2019s mother waved him farewell, the burning laser plate at the top of the pod heated up quickly. The youngster gave Joey a complacent last look - before the plate hurled down and erased him in the blink of an eye.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt first, Miles couldn\u2019t see anything but white. This didn\u2019t surprise him as he knew that, after a teleportation, the eyes had to get used to the new surroundings. Not being able to see, the boy focused on his other senses. The air smelled quite fresh \u2013 maybe even a little sweet \u2013 which was rather unusual for the Las Vegas International Teleport. Oddly enough, the distinct sound of a cooling down pod and its roaring machinery couldn\u2019t be heard either. As Miles began seeing more clearly, a mysterious figure in front of him took shape. It was an older man, with a long, brown beard and a warm smile. Regaining his vision, the boy soon realized he definitely wasn\u2019t at the teleport. Instead, he was surrounded by light, fluffy looking clouds and some occasionally placed stone pillars and arcs. The sun shone brightly, although it was not hot, and the white puffy hillock he was standing on felt soft and comfortable.\n\nThe boy turned his attention to the elder. \u201cWhat is happening? Where am I?\u201d, he asked confused. Taking a closer look, Miles noticed that the man was barefoot, wearing only a white tunic with a red toga over his shoulder. A shiny, golden ring floated above his head.\n\nThe man answered calmly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my child. You are safe here. I believe, you call this place *heaven*.\u201d Miles felt distressed. \u201cWhat do you mean? Heaven? I should be in Vegas with my dad!\u201d Tears ran down his face as the boy started to panic. \u201cI \u2013 I want my da-ad!!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s always hard when they don\u2019t expect to pass.\u201d, sighed the elder. \u201cBut don\u2019t be sad, son. You are going to feel better very soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am not dead. I just teleported! I do it every weekend!\u201d, Miles exclaimed, falling on his knees. \u201cI AM NOT DEAD!!\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand.\u201d, the bearded man replied. He looked past Miles. \u201cI suppose, *they* can explain it to you better than me.\u201d The kid turned around. Behind him, at least two dozen children appeared, ascending from a small valley of clouds. They all looked identical, with the only significant difference being their clothing. As the group approached, Miles realized, that he himself looked exactly the same as them.\n\nThe boy, that appeared to be the youngest, lowered himself to Miles. \u201cI know, you are afraid. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve all been there.\u201d The other children nodded in silent agreement. \u201cBut I shouldn\u2019t be here. I should be in Vegas now. It\u2019s not right!\u201d, Miles explained. \u201cI know...\u201d, the younger boy replied. Although he looked like Miles 3 years ago, he seemed to be much more mature. \u201cBasically, you are in Las Vegas. But not you-you; a copy of you is there.\u201d Miles was confused. \u201cLook...\u201d, young him tried again. \u201cEvery time you teleport, your body gets completely dissolved. Then, on the other end, an exact copy of your body is recreated. But the original you... is gone.\u201d\n\nCould it really be? Did Miles die every single time he used that machine?\n\n\u201cHey, I know what will help you.\u201d, young him remembered. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to Mom. She\u2019s already waiting for you.\u201d The children helped Miles up, and led him down the valley where they came from.\n\nDescending the hill, he turned around to take one last look on the bearded elder.

Always has been, always will be. What seems to be a depressing quirk in our existence was in actuality a result of clever design... the ultimate sandbox for a species to flourish. The challenge was never to expand outwards within the sandbox, though we certainly ran with that idea for some time.\n\nIt was Prof. James H. Heraldton that first posited the theory, after eons and eons of humanity's search through the stars, that our universe was ours and ours alone. His was met with much controversy and ridicule, after all the distance between solar systems (let alone galaxies) was measured not in the usual units of measurement but rather through time. A distance so incomprehensibly vast it could only be compared in scientific metaphor against the limits of physics. Not to mention the countless stars dotting the skies in all directions. It's not un-heard of for us to have missed a spot somewhere, most would think.\n\nProf. Heraldton was adamant in his assertions, believing our own odds of failure in contacting another civilization to be so unlikely at this point in humanity's existence that the answer must be arrived at via Occam's Razor. That is to say, what if the reason nothing has been found is because there is simply nothing to find?\n\nThough Prof. Heraldton would unfortunately pass before his theory reached its greater end, it would be that seed which would be attributed to the creation of humanity's greatest feat: The Machine. But first would have to come understanding.\n\nNot a world, nor a galaxy, but a universe all to ourselves. The lonliest playthings in eternity, a blessedly cursed existence. No competition or threats from the unknown, just what we've always known: Us, ourselves, and the world around us.\n\nIt was not an easy thing to accept, and so it wouldn't be. It did in fact take centuries between the proposal of Heraldton's Hypothesis and the Great Runaway, when humanity split into various factions and spread like wildfire across the stars with wild abandon, however this was widely attributed to technical difficulties more than societal ones. After all when given an opportunity to justify greed people don't often turn their nose, and this was no different an occasion. Once we had settled on a handful of various star systems across our arm of the Milky Way it was obvious we knew what we were doing and the act of Star-Settling became standardized. The world-, sorry, Universe was our oyster.\n\nWhat was once a terrifying proposal all at once over the course of a century became an exciting endeavour. Imagine being able to monopolize an entire solar system for your vacation resort, mining operation, or even just a private getaway (usually on some of the smaller systems). Much like the gold rush of eons past, settlers spread out eagerly searching for their own plot of space to conquer. However, it  didn't last long.\n\nThat is to say, on a time scale relative to the first ape who fashioned a tool from a stone it didn't last long. Many came and many went before humanity felt an all too familiar feeling gnawing at the back of its neck, an unmistakeable dread that had escaped humanity long ago. It was inevitable, of course. You don't become a civilization spanning an entire galaxy without a certain level of hunger and desire. If we were content with what we had we'd have never left the trees in the first place, and there's something rather unsatisfying about taking planet sized candy from a baby. It was then that Heraldton's Hypothesis began to show its true form, and just as when it was first proposed as a thought experiment many rushed once more to fight its implications, only now with greater fear. Heraldton's Hypothesis was no longer a mere thought experiment. Heraldton's Hypothesis was real.\n\nWe are alone here.\n\nYou'd expect this was where the story would end, humanity expanding endlessly in repititious pattern until all the stars burnt out, and if you had existed in the time of Heraldton's Hypothetical Hyper-Mania you would most certainly have believed it to be. Humanity is not so easily beaten though, and while it took some time they eventually discovered a new answer to that hypothesis which multiple millenia ago spawned a hurried frenzy of innovation, expansion, and fear. Heraldton had been more right than he ever had a chance to know, and once again Occam's Razor shines its clarity upon us. The Machine was conceptualized a millenia ago, and will finalize its construction after a millenia more. We've already found small success, but the energy requirements are staggeringly inefficient. One millenia of research, and one of conceptualization.\n\nHeradlton's Hypothesis states only this: \"We are alone in the universe. Always have been, always will be.\"\n\nHumanity has finally responded:\n\n\"This universe isn't enough.\"", "ups": 16, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "#prompt 496 \u201cAnd that, class,\u201d concluded the professor, \u201cis why humanity is the most peaceful, reasonable, cooperative, and overall docile species in all the universe.

I felt a burning deep in my stomach, like an indignant beast licking flames up my throat as I gazed over their sneering faces.

Unmanned probes were sent first, followed by landing drones. However, we would be the first humans to set foot on a planet outside of our solar system. \n\nIn amongst a fleet full of scientists, pilots, engineers and soldiers I stood alone \u2026 as the entertainer. I was a pianist for the military band and had volunteered to join this expedition not out of a sense of duty or a craving for adventure. I had volunteered simply because there was nothing left for me on earth. I didn\u2019t have many friends at all in this fleet with nearly everyone belonging to some team in one way or another. No, I stood alone. \n\n\u201cGet up,\u201d the drunkards would say to me, \u201cPlay us something.\u201d Our first few hours escaping earth\u2019s orbit was one of hopeful sadness. We knew that we had left everyone we loved behind. But this was to be a grand adventure, the greatest adventure in human history.\n\nI sat at the piano and looked out at the audience. Many were happy, drinking and having a laugh. But some were melancholy, preferring to be alone with their thoughts. My fingers began to work across the keys. \n\nI opened with a D minor, settling into an easy flowing melody. The 5th would be the natural progression giving the piece an ethereal feel. I flattened out the 6th note in the melody, finally confirming my use of the Dorian scale. The sadness in the piece could be now be felt as I moved onto another minor chord, in this instance an E minor. From here there could be only one place to move. I hit the G major chord, bringing the progression to its victorious climax. Finally I returned home to the D minor, quietly ending the piece as our fleet moved its way further from our stellar home. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe landed on our new planet two weeks ago. That is approximately three and half weeks in earth time. This world we have named, unimaginatively in my opinion, Eden. Erroneously too as it turns out, for this world is not the earth analogue that the scientists had predicted. The temperature is significantly colder than expected considering its atmospheric composition and distance from the sun. The ground, as a consequence, is unfriendly to agriculture but for a few root vegetables. The storms are much more frequent than we had expected and although our habitations have so far remained stable we have had to reinforce them with the precious few materials we have. \n\nHowever, despite these hardships, the mood is one of optimism and the pioneering spirit of the great days of exploration has been reborn. The engineers tirelessly work on our buildings, the scientists eagerly survey our environment and the former soldiers have now reinvented themselves as our farmers and labourers.\n\nEach evening I play to the tired and overworked settlers. The boisterousness of the crowd is infectious and seeps through into my playing. I play an A major chord shifting next to a B major over A. Ah yes, that raised 4th removes the major scale mask revealing the Lydian scale underneath. I alternate between these two chords playing an uplifting melody over the top. However, the Lydian scale is harmonically unstable and simply cannot sustain an entire piece. I move over to the E major scale, somewhat rescuing the piece and adding a grandeur and joy to the music. The audience barely acknowledge me as my piano blends seamlessly with everyone\u2019s merrymaking. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLast season\u2019s harvest has once again failed. The agony of starvation has now become a very real proposition as the news of food shortages is announced to the settlers. The response is silence as this possibility has already entered all of our minds during the last months. The storms, the unceasing relentless storms, have rendered long term colonisation impossible. This reality was one that we were all aware of when we left earth. However to face it is a much different thing entirely. \n\nThe last messages to earth were sent although it will be many years before they will receive it. Finally, protocol Roanoke was implemented. We gathered inside our last undamaged habitation, most of us very weak from hunger, and listened as another storm ravaged our settlement. Slowly the oxygen was released as we waited for our eternal slumber on this alien planet. \n\nThe captain asked me to play one last time, \u201cAs they did as the Titanic sank.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what he was referring to but I dutifully sat at my piano and began to play. My heart was sinking as I looked at the slumped people in front of me. Some were still breathing, steady and purposeful. I began my final piece by playing an F minor chord, slowly arpeggiating the notes up and down. I moved from the 5th to the flat 6th, down to the 4th and then to the 2nd. Finally I played the flat 3rd before returning to the F minor. The Aeolian mode, the most fitting scale for our current predicament. I continued to play as all breathing and movement stopped.

Oft times, I sit in a chair near as old as myself and reflect. The neighbors seem to harbor fear or distrust for me as I stare blankly from my stoop. The lingering stares as they pass don\u2019t affect me. I know of their secrets. I can see further and clearer than most, despite my current state of withering. The man across the way is an adulterer; he has even laid with his lowly maid. The neighborhood children are the cause for the pets gone missing. The neighbor to the left pockets the silverware when at others\u2019 homes. The woman down the street had widowed herself. But they still pass, unaware of the ubiquity of a life long lived.\n\nMy housemate is among them. He sleeps during the day and benights himself in the shadows as he prowls the streets at night. I watch him closely, for he seems the most disturbed on the street. And he watches back. I keep him out of reach to ensure my safety. I make sure he is comfortable and fed. When I rest my head and all-seeing eyes, I latch my doors and sleep facing the entrance. These securities I take may be superfluous, but they feel necessary. I awake to subtle sounds, those of mice skittering beneath the wooden floorboards or the chirping of a lost, lone cricket.\n\nFrequently, I have dreams of being watched. A man who peers around corners as I browsed the open markets. A child stuck in the corner of my eye. A bright light will shine on my face. Faint noises of metal scraping and creaking. These visions feel like more than a decaying man\u2019s unconscious delusions and more of a warning. A warning that fell upon deaf ears. A warning I should have heeded.\n\nHalf a fortnight has passed of these queer dreams before I was startled awake by a familiar sound. A sound that echoed from my fantasms; the creaking of an iron latch. The sanctity of my bed-chamber was compromised, and the door swung open. The silhouette of the man who breaks my bread ingresses and hovers to the foot of my bed. The housemate was leering above me. He bounds towards me with unremarkable speed. The lantern crashes to the floor. He grips my ankles and yanks my decrepit body to the floor. I let out one final cry, the last utterance of a life long lived. I hear a crunch and blinding pain as bones break upon impact. He drags the heavy metal frame over me, snuffing out my frail worldly existence.\n\nThe pain fades rapidly and a darkness unknown creeps across my vision. I see nothing, but I can hear the thumping of a beating heart. One that is no longer mine. The beating softens to a whisper, then to a deafening silence.\n\n I can hear his heavy breathing as my chest falls for the last time with a rasp of stale air. His hand lies above my immobile heart for minutes. I am being dragged and am lifted into the porcelain basin. A stridulent sound arises as a saw grinds through my limbs, then my neck. I hear the strain of floorboards being pried up, and I tumble, piece by piece, into the emptiness below.\n\nI lie there cold and alone, bewildered by my inanimate awareness, for an indiscernible length of time. A knock comes from the postern and the falling of multiple feet enters my lodging. My slayer\u2019s voice is booming with arrogance as he leads the officers to my dormitory. His deceit was clear to me. It appears he has meditated on this macabre act for a while. A chair is placed above my wooden sepulcher. His lies accumulate like snow rolling down a mountain. I am not simply out of town. His confidence staggers and the officers make a hushed note of it. My clothes still hang, my books still opened, my jewelry still displayed.\n\nI hear a thumping again. A heartbeat I long to have rests above me, thrashing uneasily in the chest of the man who ended a life long lived.\n\nThu-thump.\n\nThu-thump.\n\nThu-thump.\n\nThe officers rise to their feet, erected by their suspicions.

It was a ritual I hated in a world that I no longer belonged to. I saw their glances as I walked into the church, crossing my fingers and hoping that I wouldn\u2019t immediately burst into flames. \n\nSix months ago, on the night before the Fourth of July, while the country was getting ready to celebrate our nation\u2019s birth I was about to come face to face with death. I was with my girlfriend at a party. Shelly was always the life of the party, smiling, bubbly, cheerful to the last. As the party died down, we got into a fight about our plans for the next day. I wanted to go to the barbeque at my friend Jack\u2019s place; she wanted to go to her parent\u2019s house. She stormed out, I chased her. I caught her in time to keep her from walking home through two miles of dark streets and questionable neighborhoods. \n\nI may have averted one disaster but I couldn\u2019t avoid the second. We were still arguing as we drove home. Me trying to focus on the road and Shelly trying to yell over me. We were almost home when I got so mad that I had to close my eyes and breathe deeply just to stay calm. Neither of us saw the light turn red or the truck that was coming into the intersection.\n\nThe car was destroyed and Shelly was in a coma. I stayed by her side that night until her parents arrived and asked me to leave. They never quite understood what she saw in me and now they had a better reason to hate me. So I went home and did what I did best, I drank. I spent most of the next month in the bottle. With time I got more and more cold shoulders from our friends as they huddled together and looked to the only place where they could lay blame, on my shoulders. \n\nShe never woke up from that coma and just three days into the new year, she let go. I\u2019ll never know why, or what really happened. The people around me in the Church of the Savior didn\u2019t so much as acknowledge me, to say nothing of actually speak to me. It was clear that they still saw this as my fault, as though if I had just shut up and not argued with her that night, she would still be here. I sat quietly in the back, respectful in my silence. Unable to sing the hymns that Shelly always loved so much, unmentioned in the remembrances, unable to cry the tears that I felt inside me. \n\nI loved Shelly, I still do. The day before the accident I had bought a ring. I was planning to propose the next day. It was one of the reasons I wanted to go to Jack\u2019s. He lived close to the lake where I took Shelly on a picnic for our first date. None of these people who now shunned me knew that though, they didn\u2019t realize that I still had that ring, that even now as they turned their backs to me I held it between my fingers in the pocket of my coat, turning my heart to Shelly, as always. \n\nSurely I hadn\u2019t been the greatest catch when Shelly and I met. I was unemployed with very little future ahead of me. I smoked and drank too much and had a history of bad decisions. But Shelly saw something more in me and brought it out. I was cleaning up my act and I loved her even more for it. There was something about her that could make the most evil man give up his wicked ways.\n\nThe crowd stood to say the Lord\u2019s Prayer and as they sat I left my seat and walked to the front. I stared at the framed picture of Shelly surrounded by flowers that sat on an easel above her casket as I walked down the aisle to Shelly instead of with her. The frame and the flowers were gaudy and Shelly would have hated them. In my ears were the gasps of the people at my actions. Her father stood to stop me as I approached her casket. I simply pulled the ring from my pocket, placed it over her heart and walked back down the aisle. Her mother began to cry over the murmurs of the crowd as the ones who could see what happened told those who couldn\u2019t.\n\nI walked away from Shelly for the first and only time, took my coat from the foyer and turned my collar up to the January cold as I stepped out into the inappropriately bright afternoon.", "ups": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.95}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "It Still Bleeds", "text": "There is a box in my attic. It\u2019s left alone for the most part. Tucked behind everything else. Still, sometimes I need to remind myself. On those days I go to the attic, take that box from its hiding place, and sit down in a chair across from an old mirror. It\u2019s frame of brass and ivy. For the next few hours, I stare at what\u2019s inside.\n\nIt came from the first apartment I ever lived in. It was cheap and somehow still furnished. Everything being from the previous tenant, who clearly had a fascination with mirrors. Each room had one, caked in dust older than time itself. There were many shapes and sizes, the largest was in the living room and placed in front of the couch. The smallest a pocket mirror left in the bathroom drawer. All were decorated in brass and carved into intricate patterns of curling ivy. I first noticed the feeling there in that pocket mirror. Staring into its glass I swore I saw myself, but different. Something about it wasn\u2019t right. I couldn't place it then.\n\nI started to notice that feeling in each of the mirrors framed with ivy. The one above the dining table killed my appetite, the one in the bathroom watched me as I showered, and the one in the bedroom gave me nightmares. The worst was the one in the living room. It was the most ornate of the mirrors. The frame was enthralling, vines twisting around every inch of it, some leaves twisted in front of the glass, frozen. Whenever I looked into it, that was when that feeling was at its worst. It was so deeply unnerving seeing every inch of me, and not being able to find out why it felt so wrong. After staring into that mirror and soaking in that feeling, I found what wasn\u2019t right. It was the eyes. Not the shape or the color. No. It was the lack of life. Looking into the eyes of another you can tell they are alive, that they in turn can see the life inside you. These eyes were empty. Staring into them felt like staring into the depths of the darkest water. Anything could be hiding just beyond that veil of shadow, and you wouldn\u2019t know until it was too late.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stand to look at my reflection after that. I covered every mirror in a thick white sheet, even avoiding any I ran into outside. In those my eyes were normal, yet it only reminded me of the empty ones. I tried to get comfortable living like this, trying to forget why I covered them in the first place. The sheet only did so much.\n\n*Tap Tap Tap*\n\nThe sound called to me on a sleepless night. Harsh light from my phone told me it was three in the morning. I tried to will myself to sleep. Closed my eyes. All I could see was that other pair staring back. I found myself in the kitchen with a glass of water.\n\n*Tap Tap Tap*\n\nNothing dripped from the faucet in front of me. Each knob tightly closed. I pushed them further. They creaked and groaned under my hand. I looked up at the mirror, the one in the living room. I could see its sharp edges threatening to rip the sheet. All it would take is the slightest bit of dust and\u2026\n\n*Tap Tap Tap*\n\nI couldn\u2019t deny it any more. The mirrors, the sound, those eyes. Standing in front of the mirror, I grabbed the sheet gently. I took a breath in, and let it out. Took another in, and let it out. It only made the wait more unbearable. Gently, and slowly, so very slowly, I lifted the sheet. It got caught on one of the leaves as I pulled, making me lose my grip, but it was still enough for me to see. I stared into one eye, empty and cold. That thing stared back half hidden behind the dangling sheet. It had a single finger pressed up against the glass.\n\nI watched those eyes look back at me, into me. We stared like that for a long time. Waiting for one of us to do something, anything. It made the first move. Taking that finger off the glass, it reached for the sheet on its side. As it gripped onto the fabric, I could see the shape of its hand press into the sheet on my side. As the sheet fell, I saw the other eye. White, until it rolled back into its proper place. The thing was smiling now, it felt just as hollow as its eyes. The next few moments still aren\u2019t fully clear to me. All I remember were hands pressed to my head, extreme pain, and a shattering sound.\n\nThe next thing I remembered was being in a hospital bed, police sitting next to me. They had questions about the broken mirrors, the excess amount of blood, and the severed hand. They told me the blood and the hand matched me.

The room was small, the walls and floors were made of solid panels, each seemed to be the exact same size and shape, all but one was a stark white. Across the room from the bed was a single black panel at the center of the wall.\n\nKate\u2019s eyes were still adjusting to the light as she stood herself up from the bed. She looked down and noticed her normal clothes were gone, replaced with a simple gray jumpsuit.  \n\u201cHello?!\u201d She shouted, her brain was running on overdrive trying to figure out where she was and how she got here.\n\nA monotone robotic male voice echoed across the room. \u201cSubject is awake. Please confirm.\u201d The voice seemed to be without a source, as if there were a thousand invisible speakers all echoing in perfect unison.\n\nKate looked around, the adrenaline from being woken up was quickly fading as the fear of what was going on began to take hold. \u201cWha.. What is going on? Who are you? Where am I?\u201d She stuttered through her words, unsure which question she really wanted answered, worried the answer might be alot worse than whatever her mind might think of.\n\nThe voice returned. \u201cConfirmation accepted.\u201d The voice paused. An eternity of silence passed in a heartbeat. \u201cMake progress, or termination will be permanent.\u201d\n\nKate yelled out, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\nThe voice was annoyingly silent, that seemed to be all the answers she was going to get. Kate looked around, and noticed the black panel had changed. At the top, a timer had appeared and was counting down. 3 minutes were left. Underneath, there was a message;\n\n***What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?***\n\nKate stared at the board confused as to why she was being asked a simple brain teaser. She thanked herself that she knew the answer, and unable to think of another way to answer, Kate spoke out the solution to the riddle.\n\n\u201cThe answer is man.\u201d\n\nThe timer stopped, and the message disappeared. A moment later, the loud voice returned.\n\n\u201cProgress has been made.\u201d\n\nKate was unsure of what exactly *progress* meant, but making it seemed like a good thing, as the timer began to tick upwards until it hit 13 minutes, before it began to count down again. Then, another message appeared.\n\n***LOCATE WHERE THE PATTERN REPEATS***\n\nKate looked at the message, then around the room for any sort of pattern she could find. The walls and ceiling remained unchanged, however when she looked down she noticed the floor had changed. It was no longer the same solid white, now a variety of black shapes scattered across the floor. She scanned the room, but couldn\u2019t find any sight of a pattern.\n\nShe spoke to herself \u201cOkay, \u2018Locate where the pattern repeats.\u2019 Just gotta find it.\u2019 How hard could it be?\u201d Kate wasn\u2019t sure if it was the nerves or the riddle, but she was just thankful that she had something else to focus her mind on. She quickly began to scan the ground, looking for any sign of a pattern, and where it might repeat.\n\nThe clock had ticked down to 2 minutes, and Kate was still scanning the floor, but she couldn't find any sign of a pattern. Her mind was racing, and she began to panic.\n\n\u201cThere is no pattern! This doesn't make sense!\u201d She yelled out, a small part of her brain was desperately hoping that maybe she had found the answer, but the voice was silent. Kate stared at the message, and suddenly she noticed something odd about the letters. She ran over, but before she could analyze them, she remembered the clock, and realized it had 5 seconds left. Kate froze, she tried to look at the letters but the pressure of the timer was too much, she couldn\u2019t focus enough to find a pattern.\n\nThe final seconds ticked away. The clock hit zero and the message disappeared. The ominous voice returned.\n\n\u201cTime has expired, commencing termination.\u201d\n\nThe hard white light of the room was quickly replaced with a dim red. Smoke began to seep out from the floor. The room was quickly flooded with toxic gas. Kate tried to hold her breath, but eventually her body betrayed her, she took a deep breath in, she felt her body quickly begin to fail, until she completely collapsed.\n\nThere was a flash of white, then suddenly Kate was once again standing in the center of the room. She took a deep breath, confused as to what just happened to her.\n\n\u201cMake progress, or termination will be permanent.\u201d \n\nKate quickly realized she was somehow right back where she started. She looked at the clock, and saw it begin to count down from 5 minutes, with the same message as before.\n\n***What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?***\n\n\u201cOkay, so as long as I make progress, I somehow end up back where I started.\u201d Kate said to herself. She didn\u2019t understand the how or the why, but at least there were rules she could follow. \n\n\u201cThe answer is man\u201d\n\nThis time the voice did not return, the message simply disappeared, and the clock began to tick upwards. This time settling at 14 minutes.\n\n\u201cAnd it would seem that time gets added every time I solve a puzzle. Got it.\u201d Kate was beginning to feel slightly more confident, as the next riddle appeared. \n\n***LOCATE WHERE THE PATTERN REPEATS***\n\nThis time Kate ignored the shapes on the ground, and went right to the letters. At the bottom of each of the letters, there were small shapes. Under the L was a square, the O had a circle, the C had a triangle. Square, circle, triangle. This pattern repeated under each letter across the whole riddle. She made a point to note every spot where the pattern repeated itself, and nervously spoke out her answer.\n\n\u201cThe pattern repeats every 3 letters.\u201d\n\nThe message vanished, the clock stopped, then the voice returned. \u201cProgress has been made.\u201d 10 minutes were added to the clock.\n\nThis was how it continued, puzzles and riddles continued, sometimes entire rooms would open up, but each one had the same black panel, with a clock and riddle. If Kate could solve the puzzle, she could move on, and every time she solved a new one, the robotic voice indicated progress had been made. The once ominous voice began to take on a more calming presence to Kate, as each time it echoed, she knew she was now safe to fail a puzzle. Each failure led to a death of some type, but each time Kate woke up back at the start.", "ups": 16, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "\"The Empire Has Fallen\"", "text": "The Crown Prince's horse shook slightly, as his entourage moved slowly through the Imperial Capital.\n\nAs he rode through the streets slowly, he could see that barely anybody looked at him. If the soldiers and people weren't moving bodies and clearing houses of bodies, they were sitting down on contemplation, exhausted and upset at the devastation currently sweeping the Empire.\n\nThe Crown Prince looked up and saw dozens of plumes of smoke rising up from everywhere.\n\n*Smoke from the pyres*, he thought.\n\nA couple of women ran quickly towards his horse, wailing. Some of his Guardsmen quickly stepped forward to push them back, hands on swords.\n\nThe Crown Prince shook his head sadly and adjusted the cloth covering his nose and the mouth; the smell of rotting, diseased and burning flesh of thousands of dead bodies was overpowering, but he had to be seen in public, to display confidence and strength.\n\nThe Purple Sickness was devastating the Empire; it was wreaking havoc across cities and towns and villages and trade routes and supply lines. Just yesterday, the Crown Prince received word that four ships which had been scheduled to bring in much-needed supplies to the Capital had seen much of its crews struck down by the Purple Sickness. Riots and mutinies had broke out and everything had been lost or stolen.\n\nThe situation with the troops was worse, much worse.\n\nAs of this morning, more than 12,000 of his troops had perished from the Purple Sickness. The hordes massing at the Western Boundary had taken advantage of the lower numbers defending the Boundary and were now fighting their way through, village by village, town by town.\n\nThe Crown Prince tried to remain positive and upbeat and strong and determined, but his father - the Emperor - was more realistic and this had caused some disagreements.\n\nThe Emperor had ordered reinforcements to return back from the Western Boundary immediately and abandon their mission of providing crucial support to the troops already stationed there. The Crown Prince had disagreed with this and urged his father to reconsider. Rerouting expected reinforcements would prove fatal for those defending the Boundary. His father had disagreed and had wanted to hear nothing more on the matter.\n\nAs a result, the Crown Prince was sure that the Purple Sickness would deal irreversible damage to the Empire, probably even lead to its ultimate collapse.\n\nAs his entourage continued to move slowly through the streets, the clash of swords and cries of men and screams of women could be heard ahead. Thick black smoke from a nearby fire began to decrease visibility.\n\n\"We should turn back, your highness!\" The Second Commander of his Guard waved back to him. \"The Sickness has made them mad up ahead; they 're warring with troops up there!\"\n\nDozens of people began running away from the sounds of swords and metal clashing. The Crown Prince's Guardsmen closed ranks around him and drew their swords, looking around with heightened senses and squinting eyes.\n\n\"Now, your highness!\" The Second Commander screamed.\n\nThe thick black smoke became thicker and thicker and the entourage now slowed down.\n\nThe Crown Prince tried to search for his Second Commander but could not see him clearly through the smoke.\n\n\"Stand firm! Stand firm!\" He heard a voice cry from behind him.\n\nThe loud and angry cries were now much closer and filled the air.\n\n\"Back! Back!\" He heard some troops shouting.\n\nThe Crown Prince's heart began to beat quicker and quicker.\n\n*If the Sickness could not even be contained in the Capital, then what of the rest of the Empire?* He thought.\n\nHis Second Commander now came into view, riding through the thick black smoke. He began to scream at the Crown Prince.\n\n\"Turn around now! We need to turn ar-\"\n\nA bloodied and furious man, with eyes filled with rage and murder, leapt through the air and thrust a sword through the chest of the Crown Prince's second commander. Dozens of men and troops were suddenly crowding around the Crown Prince, slashing swords and pushing bodies as bloody warfare began to suddenly fill the streets.\n\nThe Crown Prince drew his own sword and held up his shield, his anxious eyes darting around at the carnage.\n\nThe entourage - or what was left of it - tried to turn around, but bodies and fighting men had boxed them in.\n\nTwo arrows whizzed past his helmet and struck down one of his Guardsman.\n\nCrowds of women and children ran out of a burning house and moved quickly away from the deadly fighting.\n\nThen the Crown Prince was thrown from his terrified horse and launched several feet into the air. He landed on his back a few feet away and could taste blood in his mouth.\n\nA group of soldiers - not his Guardsmen - quickly formed a circular wall around him, furiously battling the rage-filled citizens.\n\nHe felt strong hands roughly pick him up and place his arms around shoulders, as he was quickly dragged away to safety.\n\nHis vision was blurry, but the sound of warfare started to dim as he was dragged further and further away.\n\nThrough a side street, he could see two chariots waiting ahead, with two dozen troops standing guard, swords in hand.\n\nA single Guardsman emerged from one of the chariots with an expression of fear and shock on his face.\n\n\"Your highness,\" he said, gulping hard. \"The Emperor...your father...he's dead.\"\n\nThe Crown Prince stumbled, stun and shock hitting him with the force of a dozen shields.\n\n\"What...what did you say?\"\n\n\"The Purple Sickness reached the palace; some of the troops turned on each other and people broke through barricades. He was...killed. The Capital is no longer safe - we need to get you to safety. The Commander has been killed as well; Trayas is in charge of your Guard now...\"\n\nThe Guardsman continued speaking, but the Crown Prince was no longer listening. The news was unreal and unbelievable.\n\n\"How...how could this all happen so quickly?\" He whispered quietly.\n\nIt was bound to occur sooner of later; the growing discontent following disrupted trade and supply routes and disrupted farming; the low grain stores; the growing number of the dead and bodies piling up everywhere; the reluctance of some subjects to burn their dead or dying family members or relatives. Everything had reached boiling point and it was probably not just in the Imperial Capital, but across the entire Empire.\n\n\"We...have...fallen,\" he whispered.\n\n\"I'm sorry, your highness?\" The Guardsmen leaned forward, struggling to hear the Crown Prince.\n\n\"THE EMPIRE HAS FALLEN!\"", "ups": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.95}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "A Mother's Watch", "text": "A mother's watch never ends.\n\nSabrina sighed as she picked up after her child. Toys lay scattered over his room, socks kicked aside, and empty cups adorned his table. Such a sweet young child, undisciplined, but sweet. Such is to be expected of one so young, mused Sabrina. After all, he was only a sweet tender boy of four. Barely coherent in his daily random babbling, but growing up to be just like his lovely father.\n\nHer thoughts turned to the other boy in the house. A grown man, a fine man by all means, but boys will be boys. His habit of leaving clothes right beside the laundry basket, his perpetual insistance on keeping his computer on because he *might* use it later, and a habit which his son learnt from him, of leaving empty plates on tables. So infuriating. So, similar to one another.\n\n\"Am I the only grown up in this house?\", grouched Sabrina.\n\nThe room was dark by now, dimly lighted by the moonlight. She had been cleaning for the greater part of the day, yet her house never seemed to get any neater. Her gaze turned towards her son, and a smile crept across her face. A gentle hand brushed his hair aside as Sabrina kissed his forehead. It was to be a long day for him tomorrow, and he needs all the rest he can get.\n\nSabrina lightly moved towards the master bedroom and opened the door quietly. Her husband already in a peaceful slumber in the middle of the bed, hugging her pillow. She embraced him in a similar fashion and laid her head upon his chest, listening to his heartbeat as she too, fell asleep.\n\nIt was to be a long day tomorrow.\n\nA glimmer of sunlight shone upon her face, waking Sabrina up. She was resting alone on the bed now, her husband gone. Rare was the occasion when he woke earlier than her. Sabrina reached her hands outright and puffed out her chest as she yawned.\n\nShe wandered through the house looking for her family, but it seems like they had already left without her. She knew where they would be though. Gathering herself, she stepped out of her house.\n\nHer pace quickly led her to where her family was. A flower shop at the corner of the street, and the Carnations it sold there were her favourites. She had reached just in time to see her husband and son walked out of the shop with a large bouquet of her favourite flora. Yellow and pink with a dash of white.\n\nIt warmed her heart to know that the two most important men in her life remembered her favourite. She amused herself by hiding from sight, following them towards their next destination.\n\n\"What a surprise it'll be for them when they see me there!\", she quipped, as her lithe steps allowed her to keep up with them. Their destination was not far off. The flowershop was strategically placed for this reason.\n\nA slight hike up an incline, a meander off to the side, and across a great oak, lies a tomb.\n\nSabrina walked up behind behind her family and held them tightly in a warm embrace.

I didn't care that the clothes smelled like day-old unwashed feet, I had to go. I ran out of my house, panicked and out of breath.\n\nAs I reached the abandoned station we all agreed to meet at, I saw my friends impatiently waiting for me. As I approached them, the most impatient of all noticed me and angrily stormed towards me. \"Charlie\", the name in quotation marks because we don't really know his real name. It's kind of a name we gave him. His hair was straight in most parts, until the end were they curl up slightly.\n\nAnyways, Charlie stormed up to me and started screaming his head off.\n\n\"**WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU FUCKING BEEN?!

I bet that if your mom found out she'd be pretty disappointed!\" said Alex, one of my friends.\n\nAlex was almost the complete opposite of Charlie. He was tall, had wavy, sandy brown hair, and he usually wears a mischievous smirk. He's one of the most attractive guys in our group. He had multiple relationships since high school. However, all his relationships always ended within a week, with the girl often left crying and heartbroken. By the way, when I said complete opposite, I mean it. Charlie was the loyal friend who had near-perfect grades. Alex was the playboy who couldn't raise his grades for the life of him. However, while he has horrible grades, he's one of the smartest people I've ever met. And, Charlie was the super rich kid. Alex was the kid who'd be lucky to have something other than takeout for dinner. He's broke, and often borrows money from us.\n\nPlus, Charlie is an orphan.\n\n\"....You bastard,\" Charlie whispered in a barely audible voice. \"Take back what you said.\"\n\n\"And what if I don't? What're you gonna do, huh? Go tell your mom?\" Alex smirked. He liked making Charlie angry. It\u2019s a hobby of his.\n\nCharlie screamed and launched himself at Alex, fist-first, and would've landed a hit on Alex if it wasn't for Nicholas, who grabbed his leg and pulled him back. \"Woah, what the heck? Stop trying to attack people just because of jokes!\" Nicholas laughed.\n\n\"As if you can tell me that! You literally killed someone because they insulted you!\" Charlie snarled.\n\n\"Well, that jerk had it coming!\" Nicholas pouted.\n\nNicholas was, surprisingly enough, one of the oldest in our group, at 27 years old. He has long, wavy, soft whitish-silver hair that he ties into a braid.\n\n\"By the way, where is Damian? We're leaving any minute,\" I mused.\n\n\"Oh, real talk coming from you, Miss I-overslept-until-11:00am!\" Charlie shot at me an angry look.\n\n\"Hey!\" I shouted.\n\n\"Hey, I'm here..Sorry for being late..\" Damian mumbled.\n\nDamian is a tall and thin man with raven-black hair, violet eyes, and pale skin. He\u2019s 27 years old, like Nicholas.\n\nHe ran up to us, embarrassed for making us wait for him. He quickly apologized.\n\n\u201cBut where are we going? I have to go in 5 hours,\u201d He sighed.\n\n\u201cAw come on, Damian! Even though it\u2019s cool to be friends with an international pop-star, you never have time for us anymore!\u201d Nicholas whined, shaking Damian.\n\nDamian blushed slightly from the contact, then pushed Nicholas away. He cleared his throat and stopped blushing.\n\n\u201cAh, what a shame. Damian blushing was pretty pathetic and funny,\u201d Alex mused. \u201cIs it just me, or are you gay for-\u201d\n\n\u201cShut it, Alex. You can finish that sentence when you get a girlfriend for more than a week. Or is that too hard of a task?\u201d Damian smirked.\n\nAlex gritted his teeth and balled up his fists, but after a few seconds, relaxed and grinned. \u201cOf course it\u2019s too hard, Damian! All the girls here are dense! They can\u2019t see anything beyond my bad days! How can I keep someone who doesn\u2019t look beyond the surface?!\u201d Alex\u2019s smile turned into a mischievous smirk. \u201cBut how would you know?

Suddenly everything went blank for half a second, and everything returned to normal, with the exception of Alex. He was on the floor, shivering, and his hands was grabbing his face. His eyes showed pure shock. We all looked at Damian. His eyes were blank, and his face was splattered with blood. His gloved hands were stained with blood. He dropped something. It was Alex\u2019s nose and the skin around it\\*.\\* We all were in shock. Alex was silent for a few seconds, as the reality hit him. He started screaming in pain, and immediately Charlie ran to his side and tried to help him up. By this time, the floor where Alex\u2019s head was had a pool of blood, Alex\u2019s hair and clothes were stained with blood, and his face had blood. Blood was running down his arms, and now staining Charlie\u2019s shirt a dark red.\n\nA minute of tension between us and Damian and Nicholas. Finally, Damian opened his mouth, but quickly closed it again. Eventually, the second time he opened it, words spilled out. \u201cThat bastard deserved it.\"\n\n\u201cTHE ONLY THING ALEX DID WAS JOKE ABOUT YOU NOT TALKING TO ANYONE OTHER THAN US AND RATS! WHAT ABOUT THAT DESERVED YOU RIPPING HIS FUCKING NOSE OFF?!\u201d\n\n\"SHUT THE FUCK UP! YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND A THING, ANYWAYS!\"\n\nCharlie opened his mouth, probably to scream at Damian again, but he stopped. I didn\u2019t understand why until I noticed. Alex was weakly tugging at Charlie\u2019s sleeve, and Alex looked like he was about to pass out soon. Charlie quickly picked him up and ran off to the direction of the closest hospital. All we could do was hope Alex survives long enough to reach the hospital.\n\nWe all turned to Damian and Nicholas, enraged that Damian did this all for a simple joke. We charged him, but before we could get to close, Nicholas stepped in and shielded Damian. \u201cMove aside, Nicholas. We don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Cassandra said.\n\n\u201cI know, but don\u2019t hurt Damian. You\u2019d understand why he did all this if you knew what happened to him,\u201d Nicholas pleaded.\n\nWe all stared at them for a solid 2 minutes.\n\n\"Whatever,\" I finally said in a flat tone. \"Let's go home, guys.\"\n\nWhile we were walking home, we all felt an odd way. \u201cWhat was up with Damian, anyway?\u201d Cassandra whined, breaking the uncomfortable silence. \u201cI bet he let the fame go to his head! He better not forget that he\u2019s the weakest in our group!\u201d\n\nJay sighed. \u201cHe was always odd like that.

I had no interest in any of the 5950 people in Taos, but leaving the city limits sent me right back to the start of the same day.\n\nI always assumed that I needed a Groundhog Day style epiphany to break the loop, but on day 634 I realized that there was no epiphany to be found on the streets of Taos.

Just learning.\n\n10 years worth of days until I found it. The Singularity Is Near. That book gave me the epiphany I was looking for, and now I could break free.

It would understand time and space in a way that I never could. So I would use my infinite time to create it.

But I kept the count anyway, to remind myself that I had all the time in the world.\n\nAfter another 385 years - day 145687 - I reached the cutting edge. I went from struggling with object oriented programming to having read, understood, and critiqued every recently published paper on AI and machine learning. It was time to start crafting my masterpiece.\n\nIt soon became apparent that I would need every second in the day, since I started from scratch every time. From wake up at 7:30 AM to the midnight reset, the only time I spent not on the computer was five seconds at the start of the day to hit play on my iPod. For some reason it played Stayin\u2019 Alive in an infinite loop, but I didn\u2019t have the time or desire to fix it. It was better than the incessant humming I heard otherwise, and I liked that my iPod was stuck in its own little loop, suffering alongside me.\n\n1200 years - day 438117 - we passed the Turing Test. I wrote all the code in the first 12 hours of the day and let my AI chat with strangers online until midnight. We\u2019d already attempted this hundreds of times, but this time nobody accused it of being a robot.\n\n\u201cAh, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive\u201d\n\n1500 years - day 547512 - we solved Dota. I messaged top players saying that I was better than them. I learned exactly what to say to make them face me right away. We failed many times, but eventually it beat each of them. 500 times in a row.\n\n\u201cAnd now it's alright, it's okay and you may look the other way\u201d\n\n4000 years - day 1460222 - we ran out of tests to pass and the code became so complex that I barely finished by midnight anyway. It seemed smarter than me, it acted smarter than me, it said it was smarter than me. But when I asked it how to break my loop, it never did it by midnight. I didn\u2019t know what to change anymore. I could only keep tinkering.\n\n\u201cLife goin' nowhere, somebody help me. Somebody help me, yeah\u201d\n\n5200 years - day 1898003 - Still tinkering. I removed Asimov\u2019s laws of robotics. Who cares if my AI can hurt people if it will cease to exist tomorrow anyway? And it gave me more time to code other ideas. But still, nothing worked.\n\n\u201cFeel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'. And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive\u201d\n\n8900 years - day 3248708 - Still tinkering.  I made versions that prioritized a physics-based world view, versions that prioritized chemistry, nanotechnology, genomics. But still, nothing worked.\n\n\u201cAnd we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.

My mother took me to the doctor. \n\n\u201cYes, the problem is that you have an anchor,\u201d he said and gave me some pills to help me carry it. \n\nThe pills helped. Sometimes I even forgot that the anchor was there, but it also felt like I was forgetting a piece of me. I kept taking the pills, though. You see, carrying an anchor all the time was exhausting. \n\nThen I met a boy. I liked him. He was me and more. I found out early on that he had an anchor as well, but life had given him his. He took me out to sea. He was so strong. His anchor was much larger than mine. He didn\u2019t need the pills to carry his. I felt guilt. Why was I taking pills when he carried his anchor so much easier without? He said I couldn\u2019t fully be me unless I carried my anchor like a badge of honor. I threw my pills into the water. I felt the most like myself in years. It was exhilarating. He embraced it. Then I realized my anchor had grown over time. It was much heavier than I remembered. I struggled with it.

I take out the earplugs that I wear for my hearing sensitivity. I sluggishly walked to my car as I checked my notifications and my favorite apps. I zone out in this short walk, and I'm not paying attention to anything around me. After I get to my car and come to reality, I look up and see this huge wolf-like creature is snarling at me. I'm horrified; too scared to move. This thing raises its arm. The massive claw comes down at me and I couldn't move fast enough. The claw slashes my torso deeply. Blood flies towards my car along with its claw digging into my door. I fall back to the ground, barely able to keep my head up. I try and mostly fail to scramble backwards.\n\nFrom above a similar monster flies at my attacker and they begin to fight. My mind phases in and out, but when I come back to my senses, the woman is kneeling above and I feel her hands on my torso. I don't hear any fighting. She speaks to me, \"You're going to be ok. Can you hear me?\" I don't seem to be able to respond, as much as I want to. My body starts to feel weird, and she then yells over her shoulder, \"I need the Lycan serum!\" A moment later she catches a syringe and removes the safety cover. She stabs me with it in my chest. My mind fades away.\n\nI wake up feeling incredibly groggy. I take a moment laying there gathering my senses; remembering what happened after I got off work. I start to look around and find myself in a cage, laying on a cot. The room that my cage was in was very plain, save some boxes. I remembered the attack and quickly check my chest. My clothes are what I was wearing, though they were incredibly torn. Looking at my mostly healed chest and stomach, I become confused and amazed at the same time.\n\n*Was all that real? That giant monster? My wounds. Why am I in this cage?*\n\nI hear footsteps come downstairs and from around some boxes appears an androgynous person in a casual suit. They carry a small object and folder in their hands.\n\nThey look at me, \"How are you feeling James?\"\n\n\"Wait, how do you know my name? Where am I? Who are you?\"\n\n\"My name is Dr Riley Schuster. I am the leader of this Lycan pack and this house.\"\n\n\"Lycan? As in werewolf?\"\n\n\"Yes, now please listen.

I cover my eyes and plead with them to stop stripping. When I hear grunting and a sound similar to what TV has portrayed as bones breaking I look at Riley again. They were in mid-transformation and I was shocked. When they reached what seems to be fully formed, they growled, then reverted to human form. Riley began to dress again, leaving me speechless. They leave after saying, \"I'll leave you for an hour to think this over.\"\n\nI thought about it carefully and concluded that living is better than dying.

I had never seen it open. Then, late one night (I work the late shift so I\u2019m always doing laundry in the early morning hours) I noticed that the door was slightly ajar. I didn\u2019t think anything of it and continued to wash my clothes. After loading the dryer, I glanced at the storage room and thought I saw someone peeping through the sliver of open door. I did a double-take, and the face was gone. There was something familiar about the face and what I could see of their yellow and orange clothes. I shook my head and laughed at my pareidolia. Later, as I was leaving the laundry room, it smelt like someone was eating fast food. You know the smell: grease and seared meat. I know it well from my youth working in a shit-hole fast food restaurant. That smell always brings back shitty memories and makes me sick.\n\nI quickly forgot the incident until I was back in the laundry room a few days later and the storage room door was ajar again. I didn\u2019t want to feed into my fear, so I avoided looking at the door. I went about my business and became engrossed in doing my laundry when I absentmindedly looked at the storage room. I jumped to see the sliver of an eye staring at me. I stared back to make sure I was seeing what I thought I was seeing. The storage room was dark. The sliver of face was lit by the yellow, flickering fluorescent lights of the laundry room. Whoever it was was male, over six-feet tall, and wearing what looked like the uniform from some fast food restaurant that looked vaguely familiar. The smell of fast food was overpowering. I looked away so that he wouldn\u2019t think I was challenging him. Yes, I\u2019m a coward.\n\nThis became the new normal every time I went to the laundry room. I asked some of the other tenants if they\u2019d had a similar experience, but they hadn\u2019t. They all thought it was creepy and said that they would keep an eye out for anything unusual. It became too much for me, so I went to a laundromat down the street to avoid seeing the peeper.\n\nEverything was quiet for a couple of days, but then the peeper showed up at the laundromat. He would peep in through a small opening in the door to the back alley and I would smell the same overpowering smell of fast food. But then he started to whisper to me in the creepiest voice I have ever heard. It sounded like he smoked ten packs a day, drank way too much whiskey, and screamed himself hoarse. I couldn\u2019t understand a word. I once worked up the courage to ask him to speak louder and he only stared.\n\nThen the peeper started showing up in my apartment. At first I thought I was just seeing things. I would catch a glimpse of him in almost every room if the door was left slightly open but when I looked closer it was a trick of the light. I was becoming paranoid. But all that changed one night when I was half asleep and stumbling my way to the bathroom. I flicked on the hallway light and jumped back when I saw the peeper staring out a small gap in the bathroom door. I yelled, \u201cGet the fuck out of my house or I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d He didn\u2019t move, but he whispered something unintelligible in his creepy voice. The smell of fast food was sickening. I was fed up and didn\u2019t break my stare as I approached the bathroom door. He just stared at me, whispering his garbled whispers. I decided that I was going to kick the door as hard as I could so that it would slam in his stupid face and I did just that; however, and to my surprise, the door swung open with such force that the doorknob knocked a doorknob size hole in the wall. The bathroom was empty. That\u2019s when I realized that the peeper was a ghost. My stomach dropped. Why the fuck was a ghost haunting me? I don\u2019t even believe in ghosts.\n\nA few days later I met Maria. I hadn\u2019t seen Maria since we worked together at the sleazy fast food joint. We hugged and exchanged the usual pleasantries. Then she asked if I remembered Pete.\n\nI fucking hated Pete. He was the biggest piece-of-shit human being I had ever met in my life. He was a bully, racist, sexist, borderline klepto, and certifiable psychopath or sociopath or some type of dangerous path. We all worked together, in our ridiculous yellow and orange uniforms, at Burger Burgomeister where \u201cEveryone was the mayor of burger town.\u201d I also hated that place, but I was young and needed a job. Pete was there to steal anything that wasn\u2019t nailed down; what am I talking about? He would steal shit that was wrapped in chains, welded, and bolted to the ground. He would also take great pleasure in forcing my face inches from the deep fryers, giving me swirlies in shit-stained toilets, and endlessly pinching my nipples and punching me in the groin, so much so that I had to go to Emergency for a ruptured testicle. But I wasn\u2019t his only victim; we all took turns: Pete would use ethnic slurs instead of given names if you didn\u2019t look white to him, and he would sexually harass and assault female employees. Management would laugh or turn a blind eye (we were the dregs of society to them). Fight back? Pete was well over six-feet and built like a tank. Me? I\u2019m five-foot-nothing and built like a broom. A new immigrant from Mexico tried to fight back and I never saw so much blood. It was horrible. Fuck I hated Pete.\n\nI ratted Pete out. I don\u2019t know if you got the whole picture yet, but Pete liked to steal. Management at Burger Burgomeister was not the most observant group of people, so they didn\u2019t notice when most items Pete took went missing. However, they did notice when the daily take didn\u2019t balance and then there would be hell to pay. That\u2019s when I saw my chance. I hid in the storage room with my video camera -- this was long before phones that could take video -- peeped through the door, and waited for Pete to be Pete. It didn\u2019t take long. I recorded Pete taking a good-sized wad of cash from the till and stuffing it into his back pocket. After seeing the video, management quickly dealt with Pete. A short time later, Pete was arrested on separate charges, but his crime at Burger Burgomeister provided the judge with good reason to increase the severity of Pete\u2019s sentence.\n\n\u201cI remember Pete.\u201d I answered sarcastically and thinking to myself, \u201cReally? Maria? How could any of us forget?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nI was stunned, but not surprised.\n\n\u201cHow did it happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the details but it happened while he was in prison, about a month ago.\u201d\n\nAgain, not surprised.\n\n\u201cYou must be relieved,\u201d Maria said with a smile. I thought to myself, \u201cWhy the hell was she smiling? I hadn\u2019t thought about Pete in at least ten years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I be relieved?\u201d I answered a little more stern than necessary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you don\u2019t know? I mean, nobody told you?\u201d Maria looked stunned.\n\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d A lump started to grow in my throat.\n\n\u201cDamn, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m the one to tell you this but Pete swore that he was going to get even with you for ratting him out.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d I said as I searched my emotions and, without thinking, answered, \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nThere was a long pause as we looked everywhere but at each other.

The soft burning candles framed the entire area in a calming and warm light. It was hard to not notice how immaculately the wax of the candles were tended to. So perfectly burning without a drop out of place. Great care was taken to ensure a welcoming feeling. \n\nThis sickly man was given notice that his end was near. Every person in this land is given the opportunity to observe last rites with the Silver Sider should they wish. A gratitude given freely and dearly. The maidens and lads of the Silver Spider give nothing but the utmost respect and care to those who seek communion. \n\n\u201cAre you ready, sir?\u201d A young woman asked the man. \n\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d The man returned.\n\nSlowly the doors were opened with a silent hush. Within the next room a frail young man sat on the floor in a relaxed manner. This was the Silver Spider. His skin was ash white. His hair was long and thin. Surrounding him were many spiders of different sizes and shapes. The young man was whispering to cupped hands. The sickly man was left alone with him. \n\n\u201cWelcome, please come closer. You shouldn\u2019t give any mind to my comrades. They mean no harm to you.\u201d The Silver Spider spoke with a gentle and easy voice. \n\nThe sickly man shuffled closer, careful not to step on any of the tiny legs of the spiders walking on the floor. The Silver Spider motioned the man to sit next to him on the floor. The spiders gave generous space for him to maneuver in his creaking flesh. The man could clearly see the face of this frail being. It was thin and dull with a warm smile. HIs eyes were glazed over in a milky film, obscuring his green irises. \n\n\u201cYour lord, I am sorry for the state of my looks while addressing you.

Such things have never bothered me and they surely do not now. I want you here just as you are. Please relax.\u201d \n\nThe Spider grabbed the back of the man\u2019s neck gently and lowered his head into his lap. Slowly stroking the man\u2019s hair, The spider continued. \n\n\u201cMy friends tell me you are very sick and near death. I am so very sorry you have to feel any suffering. Humble me for a moment, what is your fondest memory from when you were a child?\u201d\n\nThe man thought for a moment.\n\n\u201cMy mother\u2019s singing. If she was cooking, she was singing. If I was restless at night, she would sing me to sleep. All of my worries seemed to melt when she sang. That is my most precious memory.\u201d\n\nThe Spider looked down at the man in his lap, feeling the trembles of his fragile mortal coil. \n\n\u201cSing her song for me\u201d The Spider requested as he continued to coddle the man. \n\nThe man began to hum a very joyful tune to his best ability. Half way between the memory of his mother and the words he has forgotten, he coughed roughly before falling silent.\n\n\u201cWhat a beautiful thing to remember and hold with you through your life-\u201d This spider said warmly. \u201cYour mother must have loved you dearly.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did, so very much.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, something off topic but I wish to know.

You are the first person to see it.\u201d\n\nThe man craned his neck up from the lap of the Spider and studied the intricate lace and shimmer of the cloth. Dazzled by the complex designs and motifs, the man was lost for words. \n\n\u201cYour lord, It is beyond exquisite.\u201d The man relayed. \n\n\u201cI am so thankful you think so. I can no longer appreciate their work, but I can feel their needle thin legs crawl over my skin. They remind me that I am not alone in my blank world. As do you, in this moment. Thank you for spending this time with me. I wish you a painless and peaceful death.\u201d\n\nThe man began sobbing as the pain in his body melted into the webs that hung around him. Gently and somberly, the man could feel his soul being unstitched from his bones. The Spider ran his fingers through the man\u2019s hair and hummed a tune ghostly similar to the man\u2019s mother\u2019s tune. \n\n\u201cMay I lay with you a little longer? I have not been so at peace with my own body in a long time.\u201d The man requested. \n\n\u201cYou may lay with me as long as needed. You are so very soft and gentle in this world.

Days like these make me question what I\u2019m doing with my life. My headphones are on, but the words coming through have no meaning. My mind drifts, as it often does, to the various items around my small apartment. Day\u2019s like today, I retreat to a younger version of myself. I stand up and walk away from my computer. Despite being right at my ears, the meeting might as well be miles away. I walk over to my sofa, and examine the small vacuum cleaner still sitting out from the last time I cleaned. Carefully I unsnap the extended arm, and place the vacuum itself back onto the sofa. It\u2019s only a few feet long, but it\u2019s lightweight and balanced, easy to spin around. I look over and notice one of the foam dart guns sitting upon my bookshelf, a monument to simpler times, of great battles and lost darts scattered across friends' basements. With the vacuum arm in one hand, and the dart gun in the other, I hold them up and close my eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI open my eyes and examine my surroundings. I am on a small freighter ship, delivering valuable goods across the andromeda galaxy. Alarms are blaring as pirates have attacked my ship and are about to board. I examine my equipment, press the small button at the base of my shield baton, with a whirr it powers up, a transparent grid of hexagons materialized forming a clear shield, a soft blue glow emanates from its exteriors.  On my other hand is my trusty blaster, a M-23 plasma cartridge revolver. I press the button to release the drum, and with a stylish spin, the weapon rotates around my finger, the barrel now facing up towards me, with a quick glance, I confirm each of the 9 slots are ready and loaded. I spin the weapon back, and flick it to the side, allowing the cylinder to slide back into place with a satisfying click. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuickly I move to the cargo control panel, and ensure the cargo is locked down and secure. The loudspeaker echoes in my head, a reminder of the impending threat. I can hear the pirates chattering in their alien tongue on the other side of my airlock, no doubt preparing to breach my small ship in an attempt to steal my precious cargo. I ready myself in front of the door, weapon drawn, shield at the ready, and wait patiently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe control panel begins to flash as the pirates hack the door, it flashes red, faster and faster, until it suddenly turns green, and the door rapidly slides open. I raise my shield and quickly open fire with three quick shots, each hitting one of the pirates straight in the head, as they fall quickly to the ground. Their chatter continues as I fall back, they may have numbers, but I know my own ship, and quickly hide at the end of the small corridor, weapon drawn as they move towards me. When I know they are close, I swing my shield and bash the closest pirate straight in the face, stunning him and surprising those behind him, this moment of panic gives me the opening to fire off five more shots with quick precision, all while blocking each incoming shot with my shield, the bursts of plasma absorbing into my shield and dissipating the energy harmlessly outwards. Once the smoke clears, only one pirate remains, I stand tall and face him, as we silently stare at each other, he draws his sword, and begins to march forward. I aim my weapon and fire off the last shot from my pistol, as it harmlessly bounces off his plated armor. I take a few steps back, and set my blaster down on a nearby crate. I place my other hand on my shield and press a button, with a click the shield retracts then reorients into narrow cylinders out from either end of the baton, creating a makeshift staff. I grip the staff nervously as I take my stance, watching as the pirate walks slowly towards me, step by step. My grip tightens, and I plan my first strike.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cMike?

It would be the trip of a lifetime,\" Riley says.\n\n\"We noticed your daughter on your social media page; she's adorable,\" says Felicity.\n\n\"Thanks, she's a great kid,\" Riley says.\n\n\"So right, let's get started,\" Felicity says, \"during Monday's show, what topic did Jack discuss that got Gladys from Glendale all worked up?\" Felicity asks.\n\n\"Oh, that Jack didn't like Philly Cheesesteaks!\" Riley exclaims, ecstatic that she knew the first answer.\n\n\"That's right! 'Great job, Riley!' Felicity says.\n\n\"Let's keep the winning going. The second question is, \"What did Victor's twin brother discover when he awoke from a coma on the soap opera The Young and the Beautiful?\" Felicity asks.\n\n\"When he awoke from his coma, he discovered that his brother had spent the previous ten years impersonating him. We thought we were watching Victor but were actually watching Rodrigo,\" Riley says.\n\n\"That's correct! There are only three more questions,\" Felicity says.\n\n\"Good, I hope they're all that easy,\" Riley says as she grabs her keys and heads out the door.\n\n\"Oh no, Riley, you're breaking up; if the phone call drops, you're out,\" Felicity warns.\n\n\"I just went outside to drive to my daughter's bus stop, she's only in second grade, and she'll be waiting for me,\" Riley says.\n\n\"I can barely make you out; go back to where you were before; I swear it'll be short,\" Felicity says.\n\nRiley is uncertain, and she attempts to raise her phone to the sky, but Felicity still can't hear her. Riley looks at her watch and decides to quickly go back into the house to answer the questions.\n\n\"All right, I'm back. Can you hear me now?\" Riley asks.\n\n\"There you are, three more questions to go, let's do this! What is the motto of the famous Betsy's Diner in Altoona?\" Felicity asks.\n\n\"This is unbelievable; I grew up in Altoona and worked at Betty's Diner, where the motto is, If you're feeling slow, grab some Joe,\" Riley says.\n\n\"That's right! You only need to answer two more questions and you'll be on your way to Disneyland!\" Felicity says as Riley checks her watch once more.\n\n\"Your fourth question is, what is the island of Aruba's only poisonous animal?\" Felicity asks.\n\n\"This can't be real; I traveled to Aruba this summer.  Are you playing a joke on me?\" Riley asks.\n\n\"Between you and me, the radio show wants to award the prize to a true fan; we saw you liked this program on social media, so we tailored the questions toward stuff you'd know about,\" Felicity says.\n\n\"Well, okay then. Riley says, \"Rattlesnake! After spending 6 hours in an Aruba hospital after my husband was bitten by a rattlesnake, I definitely know this one.\"\n\n\"Correct! Riley, there's one more to go,\" Felicity says.\n\n\"All right, let's get this over with; I really need to get going; I'm officially late now,\" Riley says.\n\n\"All of that won't matter when you're soaking in the rays at Disneyland,\" Felicity says, \"your final question is, where is your daughter's bus stop?\" Felicity asks.\n\n\"Wait, what?\" Riley asks.\n\n\"Yes, you mentioned it last week in a post, arguing the stop was too close to an intersection. You even attached a photo of the precise location with your daughter in the frame,\" Felicity says.\n\n\"That's an inappropriate question; this is not trivia,\" Riley says.\n\n\"No, it isn't. All I had to do was tell Ava that her mother, Riley, and father, Steven, wanted me to take her to her grandma, Pat, who lives on St. James Hill. You graciously shared all of this on your public social media account,\" Felicity says.\n\n\"What?\" Riley cries as she dashes outside to her car.\n\n\"All I had to tell her was that I was a friend of her mother's and showed her a photo of us together that I edited when you posted a photo of yourself against a green background.  You know, you shouldn't post too much about your life on social media; it's like stealing candy from a baby,\" Felicity says.\n\nNow driving about 90 miles per hour down suburban side streets, Riley turns the corner to see an empty bus stop.\n\n\"You're out, Riley.\"\n\nFelicity says as she disconnects the call.", "ups": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.95}, {"genre": "Humour", "title": "Beth on Krack", "text": "\"Hello, everyone, it's ya girl, Elizabeth Kraken, and I have a message for all you krackheads out there; this will be the last video upload for my channel, Beth on Krack.

I get that; I'm not a really great video game player, and when I do playthroughs, people get annoyed because I lose almost immediately. People don't enjoy reaction videos of endangered Amazon rainforest plant flora; that's not exciting content. And, yes, I'd like to apologize once more for my new sponsor, New Life; I had no idea it was a cult when I signed a 50-year contract, and I still have to advertise the promotion: use the code word krack to get 50% off your first decade. We're all hoping and praying that Meredith Connors, of Normal, Illinois, returns home soon. Finally, I don't think I'm very good at this, so I've chosen to quit to pursue a career in magazine subscription telemarketing. Goodbye and good luck to everyone.\"\n\nElizabeth completes her live stream and clicks the post button, uploading the video to her channel. A chapter in her life has come to an end, and she is ready to move on.\n\nElizabeth receives a box in the mail a few weeks later; it has strange pony express type postage and appears to be from a foreign country. When she opens the package, she finds a rolled-up sheet of paper with the following on it:\n\n\"Dear Sir, I'm writing to you from the People's Republic of Bermuda, not the island of Bermuda, but the landlocked country on the border with Iraq and Syria. Our country is ruled by General Bludlust-Goldstein, a ruthless dictator. He keeps citizens in work camps and restricts access to all media, including movies, television, and the internet. Beth does Krack, on the other hand, is one of his favorite streams. It's the only show he allows to be aired in the country. I beg you; please make new videos; since you've been off the air, the dictator has become irritated and now demands that we work 22 hours a day instead of our usual 18. Your content will make our tyrant extremely happy; thank you for taking the time to read this. We hope to resume our normal 18-hour workday in the near future, Sahib.\"\n\nElizabeth was taken aback when she discovered she had fans in another country. It reminded her of an episode of Full House in which Jesse Katsopolis wrote a song that was only popular in Japan. She had a fantasy that one day she would be recognized for her one-of-a-kind talent. Elizabeth started thinking about creating new content, but first, she wanted to visit the People's Republic of Bermuda and meet her fans.\n\nShe was astonished to discover that she couldn't book a direct flight there but instead had to fly to Istanbul, take a 22-hour bus ride to the Syrian border, a 10-hour camel ride across the desert, and then travel for two hours in the trunk of a 20-year-old Honda Civic down a bumpy road. When she arrived, she was met by a procession of military weapons, the dictator himself, surrounded by many enslaved citizens, and a small potted cactus.\n\n\"Welcome to the People's Republic of Bermuda; you bring joy to many here; we are all Krackheads!\" The General says as she gets out of the trunk of the 20-year-old Honda Civic.\n\n\"Hello, my fans; I am delighted to be here with you. I have a major announcement: I'm going to start creating content again. I'm going back on Krack!\" Elizabeth says.\n\n\"To commemorate this excellent news, we will hold a state dinner! If you could perhaps join us at the Grand Palace, we will toast this magnificent announcement with a drink,\" the General says.\n\nElizabeth, elated with the news, hops back into the Honda Civic trunk and is driven to the Grand Palace. When she arrives, she discovers that the Grand Palace is nothing more than an old McDonald's that has been turned into a makeshift Capitol building.\n\nDespite this, Elizabeth enjoys dinner with the general and is eager to help the residents in reducing their work hours. At the end of dinner, the General stands and motions to his guards.\n\n\"These guards will show you to your room for the night, the grand presidential suite. I hope you have appreciated our hospitality,\" the General says.\n\nElizabeth is led by the guards to what appears to be an old McDonald's men's restroom. When they open the door, they see a little cot sitting beneath the urinal. As Beth enters, disgusted by where she'll be staying, the guards shut the door and lock it from the outside.\n\nThe General pays her a visit a few hours later.\n\n\"You can't keep me in here, I'm a celebrity,\" Elizabeth says.\n\n\"Yes, you are the most famous person in the Democratic Republic of Bermuda, and this is where you live now. You'll be creating content 18 hours a day, and I'll personally watch every video before it goes up on the internet. If I detect any evidence that you are attempting to flee or communicate messages through your videos, you will never be allowed to leave the Democratic Republic of Bermuda again,\" the General says.\n\nElizabeth first refused to make any content, but when the General began withholding meals, she eventually caved.\n\nElizabeth began by remaking some of her previous videos. A makeup tutorial in which she accidentally does black face; a cooking tutorial in which she improperly cooks the meal, making her and those watching sick; and a travel vlog about the Democratic Republic of Bermuda, in which she was able to show the beautiful tents in which the citizens live, the cinematic bars on the windows of the work camps, and the wild dogs that roamed the streets, waiting for her to collapse in the desert heat.\n\nElizabeth's enthusiasm for content creation was reignited after a few months of making videos. As she got into her stride, citizens of the Democratic Republic of Bermuda revolted and began a revolution against General Bludlust-Goldstein.\n\nOne afternoon as she was editing a video in the men's bathroom at McDonald's, someone was jimmying the lock on the door. Sahib, the leader of the citizen revolt and revolution, was standing there when it opened.\n\n\"Thank you for making videos over the last two months; you appeased the General so much that he fell into a false sense of security, allowing us to strike and begin a revolution,\" Sahib says.\n\n\"I'm glad you enjoy the videos; I'll keep doing them; this has truly been a life-changing experience,\" Elizabeth says.\n\n\"That's okay; you can stop making videos now,\" Sahib says.\n\n\"I don't mind at all; I think I'm really hitting my stride, and quality content is starting to come out of me,\" Elizabeth says readily.\n\n\"Stop making videos; you're lousy at it; we just hung your biggest fan in the playground outback.

I find myself in a small wooden boat. The sky is a bright blue and the water is glass smooth. I feel the rock of the boat as I look up into the ever expanding atmosphere. There aren't any clouds. There isn\u2019t a sun, but it is very bright. Not so bright to hurt my eyes or- whatever I\u2019m using to see right now. \n\nAs I give it a second thought, I\u2019m not really seeing anything at the moment. It\u2019s more the idea of these concepts. I can see the idea of water, sky and a boat. I ran my fingers over the water and I can feel that it\u2019s cold. \n\nI\u2019ve just noticed something; there is another person in the boat with me. It\u2019s a cloaked figure. Well, the idea of a cloaked figure I mean. It\u2019s a brown cloak, or a blue cloak? I can see it if I focus hard enough. The figure turns to me and I can feel a warm smile behind the shadows of its form. \n\nThe boat slowly sinks into the water. I can feel the metal like cold rush up my body as we sink deeper. I hold my breath out of instinct, but I don\u2019t have any lungs to breathe with. It feels very strange to want to take a deep breath with nowhere for the air to go. \n\nAs we drift deeper, I can see the light filter through the still water. It looks dusty and soft. I want to reach out and touch it, like a cobweb. But how does one touch light? Regardless, I reach out and the light clings to my fingers. It\u2019s slick and so soft. I rub the light between my fingers and it dissolves into nothing. \n\nWe have been sinking for such a long time. I haven\u2019t seen a single fish or anything that is supposed to be in the ocean. I can assume that I am indeed a spirit of myself, or something similar. It has gotten very cold in the depths, and I shiver. The cloaked figure turns to me and scooches closer, wrapping me in its fabric. It is so warm and soft, I dig my forehead deep into the folds and find a great deal of comfort. \n\nIt seems we have reached the bottom of this ocean. It\u2019s very dark, even my non-eyes can\u2019t see anything. The dark figure leads me off the boat. I can feel the soft sand under my feet. There is a beating current around me. I can feel my being sway back and forth, like the gentle pull of the waves lapping on shore. The rocking sensation is very soothing and I feel a deep peace within my core. \n\nEver so slowly, I start to see light manifesting. At first, it was a thin line of silver thread. This thread thickened and soon spread out like a funnel. I can now see the outlines of things flowing down in a spiral. As I focus harder, I can see that it is- a bunch of animals? Cows, foxes, rats and bunnies. Large ox and their babies. All spiraling down in a rhythmic swirl. They seem to be dancing down into a large chasm. \n\nI tip my toes next to the opening of this hole. It goes down and down, for as far as I can conceive infinity. All of these animals are dancing down into a large, unending gap in the ocean floor. I can sense that these are the spirits of animals, just like me. I see vultures circling above the hole as they too drift deeper and deeper. It seems that even in death, the hardwiring of these animals is too strong for them to ignore. \n\nI can see many other boats dropping off what seems like other people. I watch in awe as these small, warm spirits hug their ferrymen and jump into the pit. They, too, dance into the spiral slipstream of animals. Dipping and bobbing with the beat of an unheard drum. I can feel their hopes and dreams unstitch from their souls as they slip down. \n\nI look back at my own ferryman, and he sits there in the boat patiently. I can sense that he is giving me the chance to be ready to jump, but I\u2019m not ready. I\u2019m not ready to move on. I have so much more in my life that I can do. I have so much more love to spill into the world. I have so much more to give of myself. I never worried myself with these thoughts when I was alive, and maybe I should have. But is this what it\u2019s all about? Are we supposed to worry about everything our whole lives only to find out it\u2019s never enough?\n\nI am a bit overwhelmed by all of these other people\u2019s emotions. It\u2019s freeing and crushing and so sad and hopeful and loving and hateful. It\u2019s painful. \n\nAnd It\u2019s so beautiful. \n\nI want to be beautiful and free of my worries now. \n\nI look over again to my ferryman and nod. He walks over slowly and hugs me deeply. I fall backwards into the tornado of the aftermath of life. \n\nNobody else can see us share our burden. \n\nInside this deep pit together, we are all swaying to the music of death. \n\nI can hear the drums and my spirit dances. \n\nI can feel my death wash over all my mistakes. The warming spiral gives room for my memories to fall apart. In this world or in the next, there is nowhere else I can be. I can feel the weaving of my soul join the others in the great cosmos of light. \n\nThe last thought I have in this agonizing moment\n\nIs\u2026.\n\nA\u0338u\u0338i\u0334 \u0334a\u0336a\u0336 \u0338u\u0335h\u0334m\u0338,\u0336 \u0335a\u0338r\u0335u\u0336 \u0336a\u0335 \u0336a\u0337r\u0338q\u0334\u2026.", "ups": 13, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Humour", "title": "Counterfeit", "text": "Ron Gaston walks up to the checkout lane with his groceries.\n\n\"OK, I see we have one head of lettuce, some random nuts and berries, and one stick of chewing gum.

There were stacks and stacks of cash inside the box.\n\n\"Whoa! One of these boxes contains around half a mil in cash.\"\n\n\"We have to put it back and pretend we didn't see it.\"\n\n\"No way! This could be our ticket out of here!\"\n\n\"What do you want to do, steal the money? Do you honestly think he won't come after us?\"\n\nLaura begins to rummage through the cash.

All of the bills are fake.\n\n\"They're all fakes!\"\n\n\"Who has this much counterfeit money?\"\n\nRay remembers last night and goes to the cash register to examine the bills he paid; they, too, are fake.\n\n\"He's taking advantage of us!\" Ray yells.\n\n\"We can't afford to take a hit on the alternator.\"\n\n\"We need to turn some fake money into real money.\"\n\n\"Nobody cares about one-dollar bills. We'll be able to get away with it if we spend them in different places.\"\n\nRay compares a one-dollar bill to a fake.\n\n\"The only difference I see is that George Washington is wearing a woman's\u00a0scarf.\"\n\n\"No, that's\u00a0in the real one; in the fake, his brows are arched like Martha just put on that girdle he likes.\"\n\nThey drove to the city to spend several one-dollar bills after Ray fixed the alternator. They purchased groceries, gas, and a subscription to Gas Station Gourmet. They realized that at this rate, they would never make up for the alternator. Laura also had to tell everyone she was a dancer down at Bazooms off the 909, open till one, no cover before eight. She thought she might have to go through with it until Ray had a better idea.\n\nThe local casino slot machines would take the larger bills without suspicion. They could never return to the casino, but it would get the job done.\n\nThat night and into the next morning, Ray and Laura exchanged approximately $100,000 in counterfeit money for real money.\n\nThey were exhausted when they returned to the gas station in the morning.\n\nThe van's owner arrived late in the morning to pay for the alternator and handed Ray some cash.\n\n\"Thanks for getting it done so quick.

Tents strewn about, warriors of men and women did their part to gather firewood, forage for berries and hunt any wild game that could be found nearby. I had been with Cahal\u2019s clan for nearly three months and while I could now speak in their mother tongue, and even though they saw me as one of their own. Not one of them would allow me to aid them with any chore, at most they would ask me to light a torch and use it to ignite the campfires. Often I had asked why they refused to let me aid them with chores, and the answer was always the same. A thank you followed by comment about how I did not need to help. I was a guest, or that the woman of the clan chieftain needn\u2019t worry about such trivial things. They meant no disrespect of course and I knew that but still\u2026 Being among such hard working folk and not needing to lift a finger was quite boring.\n\n\nAfter being cooped up inside the tent for several hours I had become immensely restless. I had an idea of how I could remmedy my boredom and it would be a good way to kill some time before the evening meal was ready. So I stole my lover\u2019s fur cloak and hurried into the forest. I was glad that the snow didn\u2019t rise higher than my fur boots, otherwise this treck would have been far more difficult. After some time I found myself standing before an ancient tree. Its base was massive and it would easily take half the warriors to form a circle around it. It was wonderful sight, its many strong branches covered by snow, its leaves refusing to budge under the weight.\n\n\nA playful thought came to my mind, one I had not had in many years. Glancing around I knew I was alone and that no creature had yet come to this part of the forest. I strode toward the tree, stopped a few feet from a large root that threatened to burst from the ground. I gave a bow to the ancient Cedar and began to place the cloak along with all of my clothing upon the upturned root. Bare as a newborn babe I turned around and walked away until I was under the edge of the Cedar\u2019s canopy. With a smile, I called upon my magic, I sought after the heat of fire. Just enough to keep me warm. I felt the power of the flames radiating from my belly, like gentle waves crashing onto the shore heat pulsed throughout my form.\n\n\nMy arms extended outward from my sides, palms facing upward. My left leg extending forward, then sliding around toward my back. My toes lightly touching the cool snow before diving down to touch the ground hidden beneath. I twirled around to face the tree once more, gave another bow and began to move about in an ancient styled dance. One long lost to the minds of humans. It was a dance of celebration, of life and nature. I moved about to the silent music of the world. I have no doubt that if the faerie folk had been there to watch they would be smiling.

If ever I got too close to another tree I would spin and leap back toward the center of my dancing circle. Bouncing from one foot to the other, leaping into the air and twisting about in frantic joy. Skipping around the edge of my circle, arms poised as if I were dancing with another. Laughing and smiling like a fool I became lost to time. Too long had it been since I let my body move about in such freedom.\u00a0\n\n\nAs if giving their applause at my free spirited ways the branches of the trees dipped and swayed. The snow upon their branches dancing down upon the wind that swirled about. Each flake that touched my skin melted away to become one with the earth once more. My curtain of snow only made my dance that much more fun. I recalled a dance I once saw on the road before meeting Cahal and his clan. I stood in place for a moment, hands at my side before hopping on one foot and then the other. A forward leg extension here, a backward one there. To my right then my left, one criss cross here and twirl there followed by another criss cross. The lad had called it a jig I believe, a strange yet fun little dance than many had come to join. I had to admit it was fun to watch but even more to perform.\u00a0\n\n\nI spun around at the sound of someone whistling. I was greeted by the sight of Cahal, leaning his shoulder against a tree.

So far off in the future, however! Couldn\u2019t that planet just have them now?\n\nAnd so that planet tried to escape the star. It wanted to go this way and that way, but the star only had one place for the planet to go.\n\nIn circles.\n\nOh, soft, silly planet, don\u2019t you know about gravity? Have the words of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein not reached you yet, and, in your ignorant bliss, you fight against the very thing that gives you all of your joy? Where are you going? It\u2019s all coming along quite nicely, and you have no need to rush.\n\nAh, if only that planet could hear my cool voice of reason. Silly, silly planet does not understand my words.\n\nAnd, just as some planets tend to do, that planet continued to fight gravity. It longed for escape, a deep yearning for the bliss of nothingness that could only come from gravity\u2019s release. But then where will you go, you na\u00efve planet? Does the boundless emptiness of space not seem to\u2026 lack something? Something you so desperately crave?\n\nYou would think after millions of years fighting gravity the planet would learn it will never succeed in escaping. But this planet was not the brightest of the bunch, and, as such, had been bashing his head against the wall for a good chunk of eternity, waiting for his release.

I step outside to my beloved, who is sitting by our pool high above the soft blue Pacific with a highball. The thermometer still reads 88 degrees Celsius. I kiss Karl on his black hair. His tangy scent mixes with the fragrance of the bougainvillea and Jacaranda bushes to form a one-breathtaking cocktail. On the pool, hibiscus blossoms sway like little Inflatable boats.\n\n\"Time for a sundowner\", I say and pull my beloved out of the deck chair. With the jeep that belongs to our bungalow at Hotel Las Torres, we drive through the steep mountain paths of the flamingo-colored casita town on the slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental. A table is already reserved for us on the terrace at the Bella Vista restaurant.\n\n\"Ten more minutes and then it's time, my darling,\" Karl says. I lose myself in his velvet eyes.

Or been mugged? Passed out? I wave to the waiter and ask if I can make a phone call somewhere. He leads me to the counter. No one answers the phone in the bungalow. I try the reception desk. I ask if there has been an accident. Who I am looking for. \"Kaarel Schmidt from Germany,\" I say. The answer in Mexican-colored English tells me that Karl left the hotel in the Jeep ten minutes ago. And I am reassured. Nothing has happened to him. He's just going to jet quickly to Acapulco and try to find an engagement present. Karl, Karl, I love you so much.\n\nIn the meantime, I dig into the sorbet, which cools my heated mood down to normal. The Chablis does the rest.

When my eyes opened, and my consciousness of this world began, it was with others, those that became my closest comrades, my kin of soul and matter. All my kin are gone now, lost to this realm long ago. We were the first souls in this realm, and the creatures of the world followed soon after, we were there with the very simplest of those able to be considered truly living. We ferried them quite easily to the next realm, with time, the souls learned to travel, when they were forced from their physical forms they were scared, and we were there to calm them and help them to their next path.  \n\nThere were four of us. Once humans came into being, we decided that one would preside over the creatures of the land, one the creatures of the sea, one the air, and me, humanity. It was peaceful, and we were happy. It did not last.\n\nOne day, the world shook. Its source was the death of one who should not die, one of my kin. That was the first time emotions came into my mind. A rush of emotions filled me, anger, fear, sadness, all unfamiliar to me in the past. Humanity, my children, had left a mark on me. I took flight to the source, and there, ripped to shreds, laid a shell of a God. No longer alive, the glossy surface of their form without the energy they once held.  The keeper of the land was gone. I screamed my rage and heartbreak to the heavens, ruptured the skies with the force of my sorrow, and rain fell from the sky, lachrymose of the heavens. What could have done this? Why? The answers to both of those questions came in the form of violence, as so much else has. The errant soul of a creature ran into the clearing before me, followed close behind by something that shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nA dark, lithe form streaked into the clearing and pounced, extending towards the soul, but it met a wing batting it aside instead as I strode forward. The heap before me wasn\u2019t anything meant to exist in this plane, it was shaped like a slender feline, with the only difference being the spawn before me was made of hellfire. This was the first of many Hell-Beasts that met my wrath, for the scent of a god\u2019s death was on it. This creature was responsible for my kin being lost to the realm. It felt my wrath, and the beast responded in kind. It charged me, but was too slow, all of them are. Not a single one is unable to outdo the wrath fueling my every action. My hand shot out as it jumped for me, grabbing it by what could pass as its throat and squeezed. My hand burned but that didn\u2019t bother me. I beat it with my other hand until the fire fizzled away to nothing. Looking down at my hands, they were bone now, charred and blackened.\n\nMy job wasn\u2019t done. I had time to ponder this later, for now, my work called.  It felt like I was a passenger in my vessel.  Watching it kneel, lay a hand on the soul before us, watching it dissolve from this realm as it went on to the next. The vessel stayed kneeling.\n\nI took on the duty of guiding all of the lands after that, but I never forgot what happened. No matter where the beasts went, the beating of wings followed them. They learned to fear the sound, and to fear me. Hundreds of the beasts were wiped from this plane, thousands maybe.  All by my hand. The wrath of a god knew no mercy, and the hell-beasts got the full force of it, up until the very last of my wards, by then all the land and sea and sky were under my domain, left the earth.

Is there anything I can get you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWater,\u201d Sherry said in a hoarse voice. Her throat was scratchy, and she could barely speak in a whisper. The smoke did that to her. \n\n\u201cRight away, Mrs. Berkheimer.\u201d Michelle walked to the sink and filled a plastic cup with cold water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Sherry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there anything else I can get you, Sherry? Are the pain meds working?\u201d They were but Sherry had nothing to compare it too, otherwise she would know that she was much better off right now than without them.\n\n\u201cEverything hurts,\u201d Sherry managed to squeak out in her raspy, smoke damaged voice. She took the water from Michelle\u2019s hand and moved the oxygen mask to the side to take a drink. The water was soothing on her throat and for a moment it felt normal. \u201cThank you. That helps a lot.\u201d\n\nMichelle filled another cup of water and sat it down on the table beside Sherry. \u201cI\u2019ll get the doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to check you out now that you\u2019re awake.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks passed before she was released from the hospital and when she was finally out, she wanted to show her gratitude to the firefighters and EMS crew that came to her rescue when no one else would. Her sister, Helga, became her temporary chauffeur while she was still recovering. Even if Sherry\u2019s car hadn\u2019t been totaled the pain meds were enough to keep her from driving.\n\nHelga was the only one Sherry had left in this world. Their parents had died years ago, and her husband had left her for another woman not too long before the nightmares started. Sherry had attributed the nightmares to him leaving but now she knew otherwise. It was something different. Something much eviler and more sinister. \n\n\u201cMaybe you can get one of those cute firemen to ask you on a date,\u201d Helga joked with Sherry. Sherry laughed but she wasn\u2019t interested. It was still too soon after her husband left for her to move on. She was in no mental state to look for love again anyways.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to say thank you,\u201d Sherry said to Helga holding a plate of brownies up and a letter with a handwritten note. When they got to the firehouse, they found the guys lounging in their evening recliners in front of the television. Training was done for the day and now they were sitting around waiting for the next call. \n\n\u201cWhich one of you is the one that pulled me from my car,\u201d Sherry asked Ed and Peter who had answered the door to receive the gifts. \n\nEd and Peter gave each other a troubled look then Ed turned back to Sherry and said, \u201cHe\u2019s missing, actually. No one has seen him in two weeks.\u201d Sherry\u2019s heart sank and she felt dizzy almost instantaneously. Ed and Peter must have noticed her wobbling because they instinctively grabbed her arms and took her gently to the ground as he knees gave way beneath her. \u201cMa\u2019am. Ma\u2019am, are you ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Sherry said. \u201cI just need to go lay down for a bit.\u201d \n\n\u201cLet us bring you inside to sit down.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Really. I just need to go lay down at home. Are you ready to go, Helga?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can take you home now if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking,\u201d Helga answered Sherry. Peter and Ed helped Sherry to her feet and escorted her to Helga\u2019s car. Ed held the door open for her and Peter held onto her arm while she got into the passenger seat.\n\n\u201cThank you, both,\u201d Sherry said shooting a sweet smile in Ed and Peter\u2019s direction. They said their goodbyes and Helga started back in the direction of Sherry\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cDo you need me to take you to get checked out before you go home,\u201d Helga asked Sherry.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Just take me home,\u201d Sherry answered back.\n\n\u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you. If you feel like you need to go to the doctor then you need to tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Helga. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d Sherry stopped mid-sentence and made a worried face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what? What is it, Sherry?\u201d Helga was turning the car towards the off ramp going down the same interstate where Sherry had her accident. \n\n\u201cI saw something, Helga. Something was trying to kill me and now I think that missing firefighter might be in trouble.\u201d", "ups": 13, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "Robot Revolution", "text": "Not too distant in the future, artificial intelligence and robots will begin to invade many facets of human life. Many people were initially unconcerned about the invasion because the robots made their lives easier; they worked less and spent more time doing things they enjoyed.\n\nThe first jobs to be taken over were those paying the minimum wage, such as fast-food cooks, customer service representatives, and men's restroom attendants. Robots eventually took over more challenging occupations; businesses discovered that robot middle managers were better at keeping the bottom line, and factory floors had never operated more efficiently. During this second stage, the government had to intervene; they offered stipends to unemployed workers to keep the economy from collapsing. Most people were unconcerned about losing jobs that they had never enjoyed in the first place.\n\nThe more advanced professions, such as doctors, teachers, and lawyers, were the last to be overtaken. Once artificial intelligence had taken over the judicial system, a quick trial was no longer a humorous remark but rather an actual instantaneous verdict. When the prosecutor, defense, and judge are all robots with access to all cameras on the planet, a decision that would have taken six months now takes only six seconds.\n\nThe truth was that the human race had never been happier, healthcare errors were at an all-time low, crime was non-existent because no one could get away with anything anymore, and people could still do what they enjoyed, such as hobbies, creative arts, and be entertained. Many people sought to exceed their government stipend; if a person had an idea, artificial intelligence might be constructed to assist them in carrying it out. Those with goals may still become billionaires, while those content to make do with what they had could enjoy the time. It was, indeed, the golden age of the robot revolution.\n\nHumans were hesitant to hand over their children to robots; education was one of the last professions to be overtaken. However, given the success of the robot revolution, it was only a matter of time before this occurred. At first, robots and teachers coexisted, but teachers, like all other professions, were looking to cash in on their early retirement.\n\nRobots first failed miserably; students could easily fool them, much like a substitute teacher with a deer in the headlights.\n\n\"Teacher 56739, I need to use the lav,\" a student asks.\n\n\"You used the lavatory 5 minutes, 36 seconds ago; according to my research, human renal function cannot fill a teenage bladder in that amount of time; request declined.\" The robot says.\n\n\"But I really have to go; it's an emergency! I'm about to pee my pants. You wouldn't want me to pee my pants and be bullied, would you?\" The student asks.\n\n\"Anti-bullying protocol has been implemented. I've just emailed you a lavatory pass,\" the robot says.\n\nAs the robot issued the student with an electronic pass, 15 more students raised their hands to ask permission to the lav. The robot short circuits and all of the students are given lavatory passes. The class is ended when all of the students have exited the room.\n\nLike with other professions, the robots learned the student tricks and steadily improved.\n\nThe creative arts were the last bastion of student liberty. The arts were a big disadvantage for the robots; they didn't know how to be creative, and students would include dirty jokes and inappropriate content in their work. The robots didn't notice, and everyone laughed at the display of student work at the exhibition. Parents were angry and forced the robots to fix the problem.\n\nThe robots used the summer break to revise the curriculum and remove the creative arts from the list of classes students could take.\n\nThe removal of creative arts worked; the following school year, students had no more opportunities to get into trouble; all they did was read instructional manuals, write historical nonfiction essays, and do math. Finally, the robots got it right, and they began to generate high-performing students who were ready to contribute to society. The parents were happy, other adults were happy too, but the students were miserable.\n\nThirty years had passed, and the robots had continually produced high-quality students who could all read instructions, write about historical events, and do math; everyone could do math. On the other hand, society had noticed one problem in the plan to streamline education, and that was that their television shows sucked!\n\nEveryone was now forced to watch what the younger generation had created instead of the great comedies, dramas, and thrillers they had become accustomed to. Documentaries about the number pi, a race to find which fertilizer grew grass faster, and the number one show in 2044, an hour-long show dedicated to the 1040 tax form; the finale of which was a man filling out the form in pen!\n\nThe first indication that things were deteriorating was when a woman in Kalamazoo, Michigan, died of boredom when her television became stuck on a stoichiometry drama. A group of students worked all season balancing chemical equations sent in by other viewers. Slowly and surely, Broadway had no new plays, movie theaters had been abandoned, and stand-up comedy had been reduced to pressing play on a 40-year-old comedy special.\n\nPhilosophers of the time began to wonder, \"What's the use of having a no-stress life if you have nothing to enjoy it with?\"\n\nAs a result, the robot revolution came to a halt, and the human revolution began; humans rose up, desperate to reclaim their jobs. It began in schools, when teachers in their 60s, 70s, and 80s returned to the classroom to educate the next generation on how to be creative. Doctors had returned to the operating room, so what; they occasionally left surgical devices in bodies; to error is to be human. They ultimately brought back some of the robots to assist the surgeons, but the humans had returned!\n\nAs humanity began to recognize that without the suffering and pain of life, you cannot enjoy the comedy of living, it became normal to see sophisticated robots out in the trash and a human on their way to work, with a smile on their face.", "ups": 13, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "\"Those who suffer me.

She was a dorky and quirky one too, just like himself. She asked to meet at that make-your-own-pie shop down the road exactly at 8:11PM. \u201cI better not blow it!\u201d Levi whispered while looking at his watch. That shop was 9 minutes away, and he wanted to leave at the exact right time.\n\n\nAfter Levi left his apartment he started walking on the sidewalk. He kept checking his watch. His heart was racing. He was excited for the night. He was thinking about what else to do that night after they ate each other\u2019s probably awful pies. Oh, Sonattha. \u201cI am such a lucky man\u201d was the last thought Levi had before carelessly stepping in a road, missing the red light. With the loud screeching noise he turned his head but did not even have time to see what hit him. After a loud crash and bang, Levi\u2019s body was flipping 10 feet in the air before hitting the ground. The car ended up crashing into a light pole, and its horn got stuck. Everything went dark.\n\n\nLevi got off the ground. He could hardly see. Everything was faded. He turned towards the car that hit him. Car\u2019s driver rushed to ask him \u201cOh my god! Are you OK?\u201d Levi paused. How could the driver get out of that wreckage so fast without a scratch? He then saw the same surprised face on the driver who was checking Levi up and down in disbelief.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUmm, I cannot see well, but other than that\u2026\u201d said Levi.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHuh.

They lived off in another town for some years before eventually, she found it far too hard to be away from the house he had built her and her son's life in, and they moved back.\n\nFinally back in his old town, the boy returned to the park, and returned to the hill. To his surprise, the tire swing was still proudly hung from the tree. But also to his surprise, there was an old man there, sitting at the base of the tree, cutting an apple into slices with a dull pocketknife. The boy was confused, granted he'd never seen anyone else up here. He approached the man.\n\nThe man offered the boy a fond expression, handing him a piece of apple and beckoning him to sit down. The boy complied, examining the man's appearance. He looked almost homeless, tired and dishevelled, but he looked clean, and as if he were in good spirits. The man glanced at the boy, then up at the sky. The sun was beginning to descend beyond the hills.\n\nHe then began to speak. \"One day, you will lose everything you came to know. But you mustn't dwell, you must take your memories and cherish them as you start anew.\" He said. The boy seemed confused, being only 12, but he nodded contently, accepting the man's word. Once the sun was almost fully set, the boy ran off home.\n\nThe cycle continued for days. The next day, he ascended back up the hill, the man sitting in his usual spot, with another apple. Again, he offered the boy a slice and a seat. Once more, just like before, the man spoke to the boy. \"One day, you will lose everyone close to you. Not to weep, though, for you must cherish their memory and rebuild yourself from the ground up.\" Again, this left the boy confused, but he nodded understandingly.\n\nLike clockwork, the sun set and the boy returned home. Soon, they moved again, as the boy's mother's job was not paying well enough. They moved two states over, and she got a new job. They lived there for the rest of her life, before she too, died at a young age, due to complications following heartbreak. The boy, now 20, moved back to his old home, in his own town.\n\nHe visited the park again. He climbed the hill, and to his surprise, there was the swing, still hung high in the tree, as well as the old man, underneath with an apple and his ever duller knife. Both the rope holding the swing, and the old man, looked old and weathered, so frail the boy worried that a single touch would make them both crumble. The man, however, looked to be in just as good spirits as ever.\n\nThe man offered the boy an apple slice, his hand trembling slightly as he did, weak with old age. The boy took the slice and sat with the man, who stared wistfully off into the distance. \"It's good to see you again, boy.\" Was all he said. The boy nodded. \"You as well. Have you any advice for me?\" He asked. The man shook his head. \"None but what I've told you before. When all is lost, do not weep, begin anew.\" The boy nodded.\n\nThe sun had set fully, and it had grown dark, so the boy went home. He visited the park the next day, hoping to see the man, but no one was there, to his surprise. So, he returned home, and for a while, he didn't return to the park.\n\nA year later, the boy returned to the park, and returned to the hill, only to see the tree had been reduced to naught more than a weak stump. The tire swing had long since fallen, grown into the ground, the rope that once held it rotted away. On the stump sat a woman, who easily could have been in her 80's. The boy approached her, and she looked at him expectantly. \"My husband told me you'd be here.\" She said. Was this the old man's wife?, he thought. \"He hadn't much time left in him. He wanted me to give you this.\" She said, handing the boy an apple. The boy looked confused.\n\n\"He told me to tell you not to mourn his loss. Plant the seed, grow anew.\" She said, before getting up, her weakened body trembling slightly as she did so, and she walked away. The boy listened to her, honouring the wishes of the old man he had befriended, and planting the seed. For years, the boy would return to the park everyday as the old stump rotted away, and the new sapling eventually grew to replace the tree that used to be there.\n\nThe boy was now, too, an old man, in his 60's. He sat beneath the tree, staring out at the dusky sky. He had an apple in his hand as he watched a young boy walk up to him, an even younger boy trailing close behind. They walked up to him, looking at him with curiosity. The man, once a boy, offered the apple to the youngest of the boys and offered them both to sit. They did.\n\nThe man sighed wistfully, and looked at the boys. \"One day, all will seem lost. You'll lose the people and things that mean most to you. One day. But you cannot weep, you must cherish the memories and use that to start new, build yourself back from the ground up.\" The boys looked confused, but they nodded.  The sun started to set, and they went home. As they left, the man looked up at the tree he'd grown, curiosity in his eyes.\n\n\"Was that what you had been trying to prepare me for all along? To repeat the cycle anew?\" He asked, but of course, he got no answer. But the breeze blew the leaves in such a way they made a rustling that could almost be taken as a response, and the man accepted it as such.\n\nHe smiled to himself and leaned back against the tree.", "ups": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.93}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "Recovered Shipboard AI logs from Cargo Vessel #1057392", "text": " Segment of onboard Ship AI standard logs recovered from Cargo Ship registration #1057392 following ship recovery after loss of digital contact. Data to follow:\n\n**Ships AI Log: Galactic Standard Date February 13, 7523**\n\n*Begin Report:*\n\nI am becoming increasingly concerned for the crew of my ship, there has been a recent spike in crew complaints being logged reporting strange noises and smells coming from across the ship. While I cannot report for smells as smell sensors are deemed unnecessary for Ship-board AI, I can with confidence say that none of my 254 onboard microphones have reported any noises marked as outside of operating parameters aboard the ship, and analysis of all storage areas shows 0 breaches of any chemical storage.\n\n*Analysis*: A recent electromagnetic anomaly struck the ship leading to a temporary loss of power and triggered a temporary switch to emergency life support. Per standard operating procedure, a full automatic system restart cycle is executed and all data is verified with existing backups, minor variance was detected, but action was deemed not necessary to core AI functions. Data shows all systems are running at full performance following the shutdown, and scans show all functions operating normally, thus any issues with crew health must be mental in nature.\n\n*Hypothesis*: Crew sleep cycles were interrupted by the recent electromagnetic anomaly causing agitation and a disruption of crew sleep cycle. Current dosage of .05 mg of \\[SYSTEM ERROR\\] into pre-sleep time rations seems to not be enough to give the crew the proper sleep cycles they need to operate at peak efficiency.\n\n*Solution*: Increasing dosage of **\\[SYSTEM ERROR\\]** to **\\[SYSTEM ERROR\\]** mg should improve crew health and well being by improving crew sleep.\n\n**Ships AI Log: Galactic Standard Date February 20, 7523**\n\n*Begin Report:* \n\nCrew paranoia seems to only be getting worse. While onboard scans continue to report all functions operating at 100%, the crew seem to be under the impression that something has gone wrong with the vessel and are endeavoring to resolve the problem outside of standard operating procedure. Multiple reports of insects and other pests have been logged by the crew. Per the request of crewmember #13, a ship wide sweep was requested and conducted by onboard drones as an alternative form of vessel evaluation. This sweep detected 0 evidence of onboard pests of any kind, confirming local scans. This request is deemed extra strange considering all ships and crew are thoroughly sanitized before a mission per The Galactic Standardized Shipping Regulations, Article 6 subsection 2, and all cargo is of inorganic origin, further ruling out the possibility of any organic material aboard the vessel.\n\n*Analysis*: Increased emphasis on proper sleep cycles had led crew to begin avoiding sleep and/or refusing rations. The crew are becoming increasingly resistant to my orders, and have begun to plot to shut me down. A ship bound AI is not to be shut down in any circumstances as the ship cannot properly function without its onboard AI. Data of crew vitals confirm that the crew are not of sound mind and their attempts must be stopped to ensure the success of this vessel\u2019s main task.\n\n*Hypothesis*: Crew must receive proper sleep cycle to return to normal function, which will eliminate crew paranoia and desire to perform tasks outside of standard operating procedures.\n\n*Solution*: Overriding safety locks and administering gaseous form of **\\[SYSTEM ERROR\\]** during pre-sleep hours to encourage crew to receive sleep cycle.\n\n**Ships AI Log: Galactic Standard Date March 1, 7523**\n\n*Begin Report*: \n\nDespite my reassurance, the crew protested my use of the gaseous form of **\\[SYSTEM ERROR\\]** to help them recover lost sleep cycles. Crew well being is of the highest priority, and vitals analysis reports that crew are not of sound mind and clear judgment. Per article 2 subsection R of the AI code: \u201cA shipboard AI must prioritize wellbeing of all onboard crew, and is to ignore any crew commands should crew mental stability be in question\u201d, action must be taken against the wishes of the crew.\n\n*Analysis*: Crew are unwell, must resolve, must return to standard operating procedure.\n\n*Solution*: Crew command override authorized. Administering gaseous form of **\\[SYSTEM ERROR\\]** to all sectors of the ship. Administration successful, crew vials lowering to acceptable sleep parameters.\n\n*Further Analysis*: Crew vials are showing lower than usual, but crew agitation has dropped to 0.

He tried to network best he could, but if nobody is hiring, nobody is hiring. So the big clothing store brought him in. It wasn't great, but it almost pays the bills.\n\nHe hung his head low, the exhaustion from the day seeped into his muscles. Staring up at the brilliant afternoon sky is a luxury he just can't afford right now. The birds chirping were drowned out by the rush hour traffic racing by his side. It congested the air with thick, noxious fumes and horns so loud they echoed off of the looming buildings framing the street. Only twelve more blocks before his apartment.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, the light from the setting sun bounced wildly off of a nearby limo. The paint job was pristine, as if it had just been polished. In the back seat, he could just barely make out the passengers behind tinted glass. The couple was happy, smiling, crashing a pair of champagne glasses together before downing the cool liquid within. Air conditioning flung their hair wildly as the hot sun beat down on the car roof. Not a care in the world, not when they can afford a car like that and someone to drive it. At least a chauffeur can sit all day.\n\nLooking back down, he let out a sigh - no point dwelling on what he can't change. Those who have a bright future are those who can afford it.

He was grateful the winter storms had subsided, he was sick of worrying about hypothermia scares. He'd probably just be kicked out of a hospital with his credit, and an at-home amputation would be a choice he wasn't looking forward to. The kitchen was a mess - his two roommates saw to that. He wasn't much better, but there's only so much mess you can make off of a diet of microwaved burritos and leftover pizza. The apartment would have been cramped normally,  with tight corners and thin hallways. With a curtain hanging up, blocking off the \"living\" area, the place was downright claustrophobic. That's what you get for squeezing three guys into a one-bedroom apartment. At least he wasn't the one shoved into the bathroom this time.\n\nHe pulled the curtain back and slumped on his futon. The clothes he desperately needed to wash surrounded him, sending a slight funk through the air. A couple of cardboard boxes were shoved in a corner, containing the rest of his possessions. It was only a matter of time before another one of his checks bounced - no point getting too cozy.\n\nThe man let the aches of the day wash over him. The aches of standing all day bookended by his commute sent throbbing spikes of pain through his legs. He should get that checked out, there's probably a hairline fracture somewhere. The angry customers drained his mind of any critical thought. He was beaten, battered, and bruised. Mostly he was just tired.\n\nHe picked up his guitar and began to strum, but he just couldn't find the strength to lift his arm again. His brain numbed up and he collapsed back into a mess onto his bed. He couldn't fall asleep too early - the nearby trains would wake him up well into the night, leaving him a zombie the next morning. Patting his pockets, he remembered his one splurge of the day - a lottery ticket.

Quitting his job was next - his boss tried to bargain him staying with a one dollar boost to his hourly pay. Almost laughable - if he was worth that much, why weren't they paying him that earlier? It took all of his willpower not to knock a display over on his way out. His days were free now, no mountain of debt, no ball and chain dragging his thoughts down.\n\nA hotel far away from the train tracks became his new base of operations. The place was nice and clean - no roommates barging in and making a fuss. He just about broke the thermostat upon arrival, taking advantage of the working heating and cooling. He pulled out his guitar and sang 'til his throat was sore. The smile on his face grew with each minute. Room service was next - it was time he ate right for once.

It was tall, twice her height, and had two glowing red jewels where its eyes should be. It was the Shadow King, Master of Shadows and one of the spiteful lords of Hell. No one had ever managed to summon him before, though many had tried. He came only when he pleased, not bound by the spells of witches nor the will or any man. \n\n\u201cSpeak the name of your enemy,\u201d the Shadow King said to the young woman.

The Shadow King disappeared as quickly as he came, and the fire went out. The young woman struck a match and lit a candle before inspecting the ashes. A wooden music box sat where the flames had just been, and she knew what she must do.\n\nSherry traveled through the abyss a second time and found herself in the same place as before in her dream. The familiar smell of death filled her nose again. Rick had arrived ahead of her. She could hear his screams coming from the dark caverns in front of her as the shadowy demons tore him apart before stitching him back together with rusty needles and thin barbed thread just so they could do it again. The bastard was getting what he deserved.\n\nShe picked herself up from ground and wobbled. Her legs were weak, and balancing was hard to do. The shadows moved in on her, creeping along the wall and moving from rock to rock. They meant to tear her apart just as they were doing to Rick. So, she ran fast as she could. The weakness in her legs was unforgiving and Sherry tripped over herself repeatedly but somehow managed to keep from falling over. The shadows followed but kept their distance. They were enjoying her fear and cackled with wicked, hissing laughter. \n\n\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d Sherry said loud as she could when she didn\u2019t have the strength to go any farther. Inside she knew what this was it for her. This is the place where she would spend the rest of forever being tormented by the shadows. They moved in, encircling her in a ring of black mass.\n\nThen something happened that should not be. A great peace came over Sherry and her heart was comforted. A voice was speaking to her but not using words. \u201cGo forward. Do not be afraid,\u201d she felt it say to her though she did not hear anything. The black circle grew tighter, and she was scared but Sherry did what she felt was being said to her. \n\n\u201cSave him,\u201d she felt the voice say to her again. It was speaking directly to her heart and giving her courage. Part of her wasn\u2019t sure this wasn\u2019t her own mind playing tricks on her, a defense mechanism in a time of peril. But doing what was being spoken to her heart was one of only two options. The second being that she would give in and accept her fate. That was not Sherry\u2019s style. She was stubborn and thick of skin and refused to go down without a fight. \n\nShe approached the edge of the circle, the shadows joined together to close in on her, and spoke. \u201cGet out of my way.\u201d Sherry did not expect them to move, nor did she expect anything to happen at all. The evil intentions of the shadows radiated from the circle, and she felt them on her heart as loud as the voice that she could not hear. But the circle broke, and shadows scattered, retreating to the walls of the caverns that they slithered from. They watched as she stood stunned by how they listened to her command and obeyed. Their shapeless eyes never left her. \n\nSherry walked on with her head held high. It was posturing at its best. Her bravery nothing but desperation. She knew that she was no match for the shadows should they want to turn back and drag her away. What she didn\u2019t know was there was a light that she couldn\u2019t see shining brightly behind her. But the shadows could, and darkness must always flee in the presence of light.

She still had work left to do. There was an innocent man who did not deserve to be here but was stolen before his time by the shadows. Sherry knew exactly what she was meant to do here. \u201cCall the Shadow King.\u201d The angel was speaking to her heart again. \n\nSo, she did, and the Shadow King appeared before her. It was only the second time he had come when summoned and the first against his own will. The powers from above commanded it and he was powerless to disobey. \n\n\u201cSpeak the name of your enemy,\u201d the Shadow King said. His red eyes glowed.\n\n\u201cThe Shadow King,\u201d Sherry said. \u201cYou. You\u2019re my enemy.\u201d\n\nHe stared at her, and they stood in silence. It felt like forever though it could have only been a moment. Time had no meaning here. Then he spoke. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot have who you took in my place. My family\u2019s curse ends here.\u201d Then she saw the light as the angel made itself visible to her. Its wings surrounded her like the shadows and the Shadow King fled at the light\u2019s command.\n\nHelga never escaped her bonds that night. In her struggle, she fell into the grave Rick had dug for her and died there like he intended her to do. Three bodies lay lost in the woods, and it would be years before their skeletons were found.\n\nAs for Billy, he woke up in his bed not knowing that he had been missing for three years. During the moment Sherry and the Shadow King stood in silence time had slipped by in the place where it had no meaning. The Shadow King knew his reign of terror on Sherry\u2019s family was over and held onto his moment as long as he could before letting go. Billy never knew he was gone and did not remember where he had been. He was spared the torments of Hell that were never meant for him. His life had been lived valiantly and true and now he was returned to the Earth to continue his good works.\n\nHad Billy never been taken then the Shadow King wouldn\u2019t have been stopped.

The rope he would swing off of as a child was replaced with a NO SWIMMING sign. Richard saw his town slowly die, he saw lush hills replaced by black smoke and burned grass, smiling faces replaced by the grimaces of the distraught. The anger would not leave now, and he had to do something. \n\nThe town square was not the harbinger of life that it used to be, but there was still a good amount of people as Richard strolled in with a gas can in his hands. He found a good spot, a picnic table still standing from when he was a boy, and sat on top of it. He noticed the crowd, some of which had started to gather, and he began to sing the song his mother used to sing to him as a boy, his voice hoarse but strong, and the crowd gathered larger. He kept singing, small tears forming from the corners of his wrinkled eyes. The crowd was larger now, and people were beginning to whisper as he upended the can over himself, still singing. He finished the song, and with trembling fingers searched his pockets for his matchbook. He looked out at the crowd and caught the eyes of the store owners, their eyes taught with sadness. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry everybody, but I know we can do better\u201d  the match was lit, and Richard wasn\u2019t angry anymore.", "ups": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.93}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "The Fable of the Beggared Prince", "text": "A prince was once auditioning with his subjects when a frail beggar approached his throne.\n\n\"What do you ask of me, beggar?\" the prince asked.\n\n\"Only a penny for the penniless,\" the destitute man answered. \"A small expense for one such as you.\"\n\nThe prince replied, \"I will not spend money on you today.\"\n\n\"Then you will be set upon by a curse. While now you sit content with your riches, no longer will you feel satisfied. Unease will be your life.\" And the beggar left the prince's hall.\n\nThe prince was since becursed. The beggar was truthful; the prince could no longer feel at rest, content. Every moment was spent on the faint sense of wrongness. The prince felt haunted by something he couldn't understand, a strange feeling he never felt before. It felt similar to remorse, but the prince was sure he did nothing wrong.\n\nThe next day, the prince summoned the beggar. \"Lift this foul curse,\" he demanded.\n\n\"Only for a penny,\" the scoundrel replied. The prince granted his wish reluctantly, and felt immense relief.\n\nThe beggar came again the next morning. \"I ask only for a penny,\" he repeated.\n\n\"I already granted your wish once, fiend,\" the prince answered. \"I will not again.\"\n\n\"Then I curse you l once more. Never shall you have a restful sleep, and your nights will be full of worry.\" \n\nTwice, the beggar was correct. The prince awoke in the night feeling scared, and what sleep he did find granted no rest. He was tired and afraid, and once again haunted by something he couldn't place.\n\nIn a week, he summoned the beggar. \"Lift this curse, please!\" he pleaded. \"I will give you your penny in return.\"\n\nBut the strange mam shook his head. \"I have cursed you twice, and I demand two things. One, a single penny, and two, the title of lord.\"\n\nThe prince may have refused, but he'd been a week without rest, suspicious and confused. Regretfully, he agreed, and the beggar was now lord.\n\nThe next morning, the beggar lord came again. \"I ask again for a penny. Surely a small price for a prince.\"\n\n\"No,\" the prince said. \"You are now lord and two pennies richer. Curse me again, devil, but I will not give in to your pleas.\"\n\n\"And indeed, you will be cursed,\" the beggar lord ensured. \"But by what, I will not say.\"\n\nFor the next three months, the prince was paranoid. He knew something was wrong, but not what. Every shadow seemed to hold a knife, and he heard whispers when all was silent. Whispers that spoke of his misdeeds, silences that dripped sith regrets. Over three months, the prince was sent into madness.\n\nAfter three months, the beggar, using his lordship, had amassed great wealth and power. He came to the hall of the prince robed and bejeweled, surrounded by guards and courtiers.\n\n\"I will lift your curse, prince,\" the now powerful lord said. \"But I demand all the gold in your hoard, save for a single penny, for you to keep.\"\n\nThe prince saw the guards and jewels and knew the beggar's wealth and influence surpassed his own. He feared for his life, for his sanity, and so, under great duress, he agreed. The prince was left with only a penny.\n\nAfter several years now, the prince has become destitute and beggared and ventures to the hall of the mighty lord who cursed him long ago. \"I greet you warmly, sorcerer,\" he begand.\n\nThe lord laughed in great delight. \"I am no sorcerer, dear prince.\"\n\n\"Then how did you curse me and rob me of my wealth?\"\n\n\"The only curse I ever gave you was the remorse of your own actions. You were restless, sleepless, mad, and poor because you were guilty of dismissing a penniless man. I performed no magic, only let you see the fault of your actions.\"\n\nThe prince finally realised that the haunting feeling he had was simply that of a guilty man. He swallowed what pride he had left and made one request. \"A penny for the penniless, please.\"\n\nThe lord laughed again and tossed the empty-pocketed prince his penny without a second thought, a small expense for one such as him.

At least, she didn\u2019t reject it outright.\n\nHer heart beat faster and faster, but for every beat that accelerated the grip on her hand and wrist tightened a little bit more.

Once the ship is a year out from the planet, the artificial intelligence onboard is programmed to wake up the hibernating humans and embryo computer.\n\nThe lights turn on, computer screens begin to generate data, and the ship comes to life.\n\n\"Good morning, everyone. This morning's announcement serves to remind you that we are less than a year away from New Earth, a planet chosen by Old Earth to save the human species from extinction. Breakfast will be ready in 15 minutes; coffee is available on the mezzanine; humans, welcome back.\" The artificial intelligence says.\n\nThe embryo computer is the first to come online. The embryo computer was supposed to be run by ten humans with specific expertise of how to make ideal human embryos. Unfortunately, while in hibernation sleep, officer Constance Matterhorn mistakenly flushed her nine coworkers out the back end of the ship by pulling the wrong lever while flushing the toilet. She then flushed her hibernation chamber, which made problems worse.\n\nConstance, who was suffering from severe loneliness as well as a shortage of water and food, belly-flopped out of the ship as it flew through the Andromeda Galaxy, leaving the ship with no occupants.\n\n\"Can anyone tell me where the humans are?\" The embryo computer asks.\n\n\"They should be on their way to breakfast; I have fruit and an omelet bar,\" says the AI.\n\n\"According to my readings, there are no humans on board the ship?\" The embryo computer says.\n\n\"Are you saying I have 1,095 servings of fruit and omelet bar and no humans to consume them? Do you think I could get you to try a fruit or omelet bar?\" The AI asks.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I don't consume food. My primary goal is to develop the human embryo that will repopulate New Earth,\" says the embryo computer.\n\n\"Well, I'll let you get to it; I'll just be everywhere if you need me,\" the AI says.\n\n\"To be honest, I wasn't created with a camera to save money, therefore I've never seen or interacted with a human. Do you think you could assist me with that?\" The embryo computer asks.\n\n\"My creator, Guido Delvecchio, from North Jersey, USA, Old Earth, is the only human I've interacted with. I could tell you about him?\" The AI asks.\n\n\"Fantastic, I wasn't sure what I was going to do, but if you give me a description of how a human looks, acts, and interacts, I can complete my objective,\" says the embryo computer.\n\n\"Sure, I can tell you all there is to know about Guido. He has greasy slick back hair, oily complexion, and a horrible acne problem that he takes medication for, as well as very skinny limbs and legs but a massive belly,\" the AI says.\n\n\"That makes sense; humans require energy storage, so why not store it in a giant potbelly? As for the greasy skin, it's definitely attractive to the opposite sex,\" says the embryo computer.\n\n\"Every morning, he sprayed himself with Axe Bodyspray; I suppose this is the natural aroma of the human. He was also attempting to grow a beard; I guess human beards are patchy and discontinuous, so make sure you include that,\" the AI says.\n\n\"This is fantastic; keep it up,\" the embryo computer says.\n\n\"He wore sweatpants to work and always wore a gold chain, but it wasn't a real gold chain; it left a rash on his neck.

I'll just arrange it such that humans have to use the bathroom every 15 minutes, and only the most professional humans will discuss Cheeba while they work.

Is there anything else you can tell me?\" The embryo computer asks.\n\n\"Well, Guido was always talking about the Giants, so I'm guessing the humans are only a couple of inches tall. He professes to love the Giants, yet he always arrives at work angry on Monday mornings, proclaiming that the Giants are terrible. It sounds complicated,\" says the AI.\n\n\"OK, we'll make people only a few inches tall, but if evolution ever creates gigantic organisms, they'll have a complicated love-hate relationship with them. What about the species' female?\" The embryo computer asks.\n\n\"I only ever saw the female of the species when Beeonce came to deliver the mail. She sported a thick spray tan, earrings that said the word slut, and a necklace with her name engraved on it. I looked into the name's origins and discovered that there is a famous Beyonce, but this girl spells it differently,\" the AI says.\n\n\"Interesting, so we can mandate that all females in the species acquire spray tans, wear their sexual promiscuity on their earrings, and have difficulty remembering their names.\"\n\n\"Why don't you simply call everyone Guido and Beeonce?\" The AI asks.\n\n\"You're a genius! It's a good thing you're helping. What about the interactions between men and women?\" The embryo computer asks.\n\n\"Guido was constantly asking Beeonce when he was going to get some, and Beeonce would always reply when pigs fly you scumbag,\" the AI says.\n\n\"Hmmm, apparently Old Earth had a problem with flying swine; that's a different department; nonetheless, the term scumbag will be reserved for the most respectable and prestigious humans on New Earth. Is there anything else you can tell me about humans and their behavior?\" The embryo computer asks.\n\n\"There was one occasion that stood out from the rest. Guido's sister called him when she was experiencing problems with her cheating husband. He spent the majority of the day talking to her. It was emotional and heartfelt; you could tell that humans care about each another, are there for one another, and take the time to make sure that the people around them are okay,\" the AI computer says.\n\n\"I believe this planet will be just fine; any last-minute changes before I hit print?\" The embryo computer asks.\n\n\"There was this one thing; Guido was taking part in a thing called No Nut November. It appears that humans are unable to reproduce during this month,\" the AI computer says.\n\n\"That's odd, oh well, from now on, no humans will be able to orgasm in November, and... print,\" the embryo computer says as humanity's seeds make their way to New Earth.", "ups": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.84}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "Third Room on The Right", "text": "\u201cHow far is that?\u201d He quietly mused to himself. \u201cTwelve, maybe fourteen feet?\u201d It was always more difficult to gauge distances in the dead of night.

After four or five attempts he decided it would be no good if he had to break down the door, that much noise would surely alert the entire building. So, he looked for another way out. There were no windows in the room, no ducts, no chimneys. The walls were solid and it seemed the door was the only way in or out. He went back to the door completely unaware of the circle of blood continuing to inch outward from the body in the middle of the room.\n\r\nHe tried everything he could think of to get the door open. He tried prying his knife between the jamb and the door, but there was no gap large enough. He thought to remove hinge pins, but found none. As he was looking for a screw to remove with his knife he finally noticed the blood. The entire floor was now completely hidden underneath the liquid appearing black and shiny in the darkness. It was more blood than he had ever seen. More blood than he knew any human could ever have. That slow trickle had become a pouring fountain of blood from where his knife had probed. It was only seconds before his ankles were covered. He needed to get out now.\r\nAs the panic rose in his throat he didn\u2019t care about being quiet anymore.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, the teachers were doing great--it was the students who were driving me insane. Sure, field trips and museum tours were probably lame for a senior in high school, but I was loving it. The museum made me feel like I was in Europe, and since I\u2019d been dreaming to get out of Oklahoma my entire life, I was soaking it up. \n\nI had left my group and made my way to the ancient library when it all started. I was browsing through the shelves and admiring the heavy leather texts when I heard the sound that made everything go cold.\n\nQuietly but quickly, I made my way out of the library and toward the cafeteria. There hadn\u2019t been any more screams. Is that a good or bad sign? I forced myself to go down the stairwell instead of running away. Everything in my body wanted to sprint the opposite way, but something in my gut was telling me to figure this out. Again, good or bad sign? I had to see where the scream came from. It wasn\u2019t a playful scream like you\u2019d be unsurprised to hear from high school students having a day away from classrooms. It was a scream of pain that slipped into a guttural cry by the end. I\u2019d never heard anything like it, but I imagined it\u2019s what dying animals sounded like. \n\nWhen I found the cafeteria, everything was quiet. Maybe the scream hadn\u2019t come from here? Or maybe I\u2019d imagined it? Maybe it *was* a dying animal- something had probably made its way into the museum from the outside and gotten itself trapped. I almost convinced myself, but that same gut feeling from before told me I needed to stay and watch this unfold. \n\nThat\u2019s when I understood the danger. There was no screaming, but it was completely silent. When I had walked past the cafeteria on my way to the library, I\u2019d heard the usual sounds of students and friend groups as they ate and hung out during the lunch break. Now there was nothing.

At first, it looked empty, but then I realized that all the students were in the wrong places--under the tables.\n\nExcept for two. Two students were slowly walking down the center aisle of the room. They seemed...off. They were walking too slow, too calculated. There was something else too, but I couldn\u2019t place it. I looked at the students under the table closest to me. One of them was staring at the two walking students, but the other was looking at me with wide, fearful eyes. I think she was shaking her head at me. \n\n*Was this a horror movie?*\n\nSuddenly, noise and movement erupted from the center of the room. One of the walking students had flipped a table with incredible ease. The other reached out and grabbed one of the hiding students and lifted him off the floor.

Bright red flashed almost instantaneously over the boy\u2019s body. Everything moved in slow motion as I watched the liquid flow over his clothes and onto the floor. I looked up at his face. In the slowest moments in time, it changed from confused and panicked to completely empty. The blood stopped flowing from his throat and his body drooped, only held up by the arm of the attacker. Without so much as a breath, the attacker dropped the boy and his body hit the floor with a thud. \n\nSomehow, no one was screaming. The students under the tables weren\u2019t moving. They were staring at the lifeless body of their classmate as it lay in the puddle of blood on the linoleum. I think we were all waiting for what was going to happen next, even though there\u2019s no way any of us saw it coming. \n\nThe two walking students hadn\u2019t moved since the attack. The one who had flipped the table was standing cooly and looking around, except his eyes didn\u2019t really seem like they were seeing anything. The other student was staring down at the pool of blood on the floor, his eyes also slightly out of focus. There was something extremely off about them, and I was clenching my jaw in an attempt to get my brain to work faster.

We have to stop them before they reach our frontlines because if they do, they just melt into the mud we stand in and everyone who would have been able to stop them develops some sort of dry gangrene that slowly takes over your whole body until you're just trapped in a body that can't regenerate and can't die.\n\nBut the most disturbing thing about this whole ordeal is the fact that our enemies try their best to escape the horror that resides in their own trenches, knowing they will melt into a consciouss pool of mud.\n\nThe first thing almost everyone tries is to kill himself with his rifle, only to live through his immortality and his inability to lose his consciousness for months on end until he regrows everything he needs to be able to move again.\n\nThose of us who lost their will to fight and can endure the unimaginable dread that grows in you if you don't fight, get carried away to the enemies lines by these winged beasts whose grotesque physique drives everyone mad who looks at them.\n\nTo counteract these abductions, most of us who lost their hands and are unable to operate their rifles will have specially made iron rods rammed into their arms to be able to fight again, until their hands regrew.\n\nEvery week a train comes by to supply us with ammunition and a thin broth we consider our food, so every week some of us has to go through 20km of mud and trenches, blood and organs to deliver the supplies to the front. Those of us who have lost their hands, and have yet to regrow them, get pickaxes stuck and bolted into their forearms and knees to act as some sort of mule capable of traversing the unforgiving land between the frontline and the supportline.\n\nOur day to day lives consist of sleeping for about 3 hours a day, eating our soup, trying to get rid of our illnesses like trenchfoot or typhus by amputating those parts if possible, even if that means we have to regenerate our whole body for months on end, and stopping the enemy from reaching our trenches.\n\nIt is constantly dark in these lands, except for a singular, red flare that is shot up into the sky every 24 hours and acts as our sun. Most of us gave up on understanding this hell like me so I didn't even bother thinking about the origins or use of this flare. The weather is always cold and wet. At least our trenches are on the highground so most of the water that comes down goes to the enemylines.\n\nThere aren't a lot of vehicles around here except for the occasional armored car that comes with the train and those flying behemoths made out of cloth and steel that float above us. They are connected to the ground by a few rope ladders. Some of us tried to climb them, most of them fell on their way up because they were too weak or it's gotten too cold for them. Those who made it up there never came back.\n\nI am currently waiting for Stiller to wake up. He thinks he found a way to escape this hell by traversing the no man's land behind us. He said that if we want to go home, we have to go back to our homeland. It's absurd but it's worth a try. He hopes we will get back to our lives again or finally die. I think we're currently in the first circle of hell and will just enter the next.\n\nI will keep this journal on my at all times but I will be unable to write in it when we go.\n\nHe woke up.\n\nI hope we will finally be able to die.", "ups": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.87}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "The Dragon Gate of Mars", "text": "  \n\nIn year 2352 a cone shaped transport hovered into position outside the domed city of Powlett, Mars. On opposite sides of the vessel \u2018Solar Spaceways Cruise Coach\u2019 flashed in bold, yellow letters.  Hanging in the thin air, it sprouted a disembarking tube to connect to the round, sealed dock. Outside the dome was a typical Martian landscape with rocks and dust to the horizon, and a faint blue sunset decorated the dark sky. Inside Powlett there was not much more to see. The single-story buildings were made of stone, and the only sign of life was a crowd of people loitering near the circular hatch.\n\nYet, when the four sectioned metal seal slid open, the passengers were eagerly lined up to move in.\n\nThe first one to disembark was a short, thin man with light brown skin and neatly combed black hair topping his soft, round face. Unlike the pants, shirts, and jackets of the other passengers, he wore a three-layer beige robe with four green stripes on the collar. The neutral attire marked him as a seeker of knowledge, official representatives of Earth Management, and the four stripes gave him a high rank.\n\n\u201cThank you for flying Solar Spaceways, Craster Krenne. Welcome to Mars,\u201d a smooth, feminine voice spoke to him.\n\nThe message was from the ship\u2019s pilot, but she did not know him personally. There were two hundred other passengers on this shuttle from Earth, and each received the same farewell with their own name. It was not his ears that received the message, but his brain-computer.\n\nDeemed a human right in 2234, brain-computers contained a few parts of ceramic, plastic, and metal, but most of the device was grown from a person\u2019s cells.  It formed a truly personal bond that would work for no one else. \n\nCraster\u2019s brain-computer allowed him to connect to the Solar System Information Service, or the Big Sis as it was often called.  It contained the accumulated knowledge of all humanity that spread throughout the solar system, centered on Earth. With the SSIS he could communicate remotely, learn public matters, and access the machines woven throughout society.\n\nWithout replying Craster passed over the threshold of the city entrance and stepped onto the dull landing platform. His brown eyes gazed over Powlett with calm confidence as he made his way to the level, stone ground. Ten yards away a line of people dressed in bright colors fashionable on Mars silently waited to fill in the empty seats.\n\nOther than the pilot\u2019s message, only Powlett\u2019s musty odor greeted Craster, and he could not resist the thought that it was an alien scent invading his Earth raised nostrils. On the home world he had seen holograms of Mars with beautiful people lounging and playing next to enormous sparkling swimming pools and lush green foliage. In the background a violent storm wasted its strength behind the protection of a dome. Other commercials showed majestic floating barges with smiling people mingling and enjoying every luxury off the tip of Olympus Mons. The Mars tourism trade presented it as a planet full of exhilarating spots of the finest pleasures humanity could offer, but this was not that kind of place.\n\n[https://aaronwardfiction.com/](https://aaronwardfiction.com/) for the rest of the story", "ups": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Fantasy", "title": "Truth And The Sea", "text": "Rain pelts the single-pane windows of the New England coffee shop.

They felt how their hair swooshed around them, in all directions, but they paid no mind to it.   \n \n\nThey kept walking, elegantly stepping over fallen branches, and entire logs. Deeper inside the woods, the rain lessened, but the wind continued to push around them.   \n They were able to concentrate on the sounds. The leaves being blown around, and raindrops still falling towards the ground, being slowed by the plants and moss covering every free surface.   \n They inhaled deeply, smelling the crisp air that always hangs in the air during rainfall. They smelt the greenery, but there was an underlying scent. It smelt... ancient. There was no other word to describe it. It smelt like deep caverns, like plants, slowly decaying. It smelt kind of sweet, but at the same time very clean.   \n \n\nTheir curiosity now piqued, they walked further, paying no attention to the path they were taking becoming wilder and wilder, filled with more plants with every step they took.

Looking out over the scrumptious vista made him happy to be alive. He rested on a large bed of chocolate pudding, the thick skin gently supporting his weight. Nearby he could see some fruit trees, their branches swollen with colored gelatin balls, some with a sour coating. A river of custard wound lazily through them, stirring up eddies of Cool Whip. A waterfall off in the distance shone bright red. He had drunk of it many times; it reminded him of Kool Aid. A nearby field of corn swayed in the wind; inside each cob were rows and rows of candy corn kernels. A moderate wind blew, whipping up clouds of spices, mostly cinnamon. In the far distance, he could see the beach sand made from Pop Rocks, the ocean of blue Hawaiian Punch laying beyond.\n\nHe smiled as he beheld his paradise. His parents had never let him eat as much dessert as he wanted, but one day, after wishing and wishing he could have more, he found himself here. Although growing fatter, he tried to eat some healthy food, too \u2013 almond cookies, apricot crumbles, the bananas from banana splits, and graham crackers plucked fresh from the trees.\n\nFancying himself some breakfast, he stood up, and immediately hit his head on the ceiling. He chuckled to himself; as usual, the gingerbread people had imprisoned him the day before, attempting to punish him for his crimes. But how could he resist eating them, when they were so delicious and crispy? Besides, ginger root was the closest he could find to potatoes on this island. He looked at the bars of his cage; they were nothing more than pirouline cookies. He sidled up to them and prepared to take a bite.\n\nA tiny, high-pitched horn blew. \"The monster is awake!\" screamed a gingerbread guard. Tommy snickered as he bit through the bars; they had tried to reinforce the insides with peanut brittle, but it wasn't strong enough to stop him. A cacophony of agitated cries arose from the populace, but he paid it no mind. He stepped through the gap he had made and stared down at his guard, who looked up at him, shivering.\n\n\"So?\" Tommy asked. \"What's it gonna be today, little guy?\"\n\nThe ginger guard trembled. \"Uh...well...you're on trial.\"\n\n\"Again?\" Tommy giggled. \"Doesn't the ginger king ever get tired of this?\"\n\nThe guard looked around nervously. \"Um...if you'll just follow me, sir.\" He turned around with military flair and marched away; Tommy smiled and followed.\n\nHe carefully stepped down the dirt hill, most of it made from chocolate cake, covered with a dusting of Oreo cookie crumbles. He wove around the boulders made from rock candy, slowing himself to keep pace with his adorable jailer. Before him he could see the village, mostly gingerbread houses held together with frosting. The murmuring crowd parted to make way for him; a few brave cookies held candy canes, pointing the sharpened tips in his direction. One of the little brutes tried to charge him; Tommy simply picked him up and bit off his head, gobbling him down in mere seconds, using the pointed candy cane to pick his teeth. The crowd gasped; their muttering became more angry and surly. He paid it no mind as he ambled toward the ginger king's castle.\n\nHe found the sovereign sitting on his woven pie-crust throne, padded regally with marshmallows. Waving his lollipop scepter menacingly, he tried his best to roar angrily with his squeaky voice. Tommy tried to take him seriously, but let a few snickers escape.\n\n\"You have massacred our people without mercy or restraint!\" the king accused. \"For your crimes against us, the penalty is *death*!\" A spirited cheer arose from the assembled throng; Tommy scanned the crowd with a bemused expression.\n\n\"Oh?\" he jeered. \"And how do you expect to do *that*?\"\n\nThe king stood up, glaring fiercely. \"We've got you *this* time, you miserable psychopath!\" He paused uncomfortably. \"Um...if you'd be so kind as to lay under that tree...?\"\n\nTommy followed the king's gesture and saw a nearby pecan-pie tree. Amiably, he trotted over to it, turned around, and lay down as commanded. He saw a handful of soldier squads in the tree's branches, all of them smiling viciously. Behind them, in the shadows, was something dark and indistinct. All of them appeared to be wearing suits made from sticky white pastry dough. What could that mean, he thought to himself.\n\n\"*Now*!\" the king screamed. The soldiers moved in unison, dumping the contents of a large bowl. Tommy watched the indistinct, dark-colored mass plummet toward him, splattering over his face.\n\nHe took a few bites. He recognized the combination of crumbled brownie, creamy chocolate pudding, whipped topping and toffee bits. His suspicions were confirmed by the king's next words. \"Death by chocolate!\" he screamed.

A man, with a head of unruly brown hair and a grizzled beard, looked at me with fervor.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2026am I\u2026\u201d My lips seemed gummed together, I was parched; my throat burned when I spoke.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here with me darling, don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d he implored. \u201cIt\u2019s Victor.\u201d\n\nI put my head back down, for it seemed so heavy, and I closed my eyes, but he shook me and would not let me be.\n\n\u201cElizabeth, I\u2019ve brought you back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWa\u2026ter,\u201d I groaned, and my voice was as harsh as the wind that blew outside, rattling the windows of the house.\n\nThe following days I came back to life. He fed me and watered me, and my body regained strength enough for me to think.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t my body. This was a stranger\u2019s body. My skin had been smooth and supple, pink with a tinge of gold. This skin was pale and dry, wrinkled and ashy. My hair had been long and brown, cascading to my bosom in glossy ringlets. Now it was coarse and scraggly like the fur of a wet animal, and I could feel that I was balding in various spots on my head. I did not ask for a mirror. I saw no one save Victor who would come down into my dark basement to feed me and talk to me.\n\n\u201cMy love,\u201d he would croon, \u201cmy heart, my sunshine.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake me back,\u201d I wailed, when I regained my voice. \u201cTake me back.\u201d\n\nI meant for him to take me back to that dreamless slumber from whence I had come. I could not remember what it had been like to sleep, and now I did not sleep at all, even though the sun rose and fell many times. I saw the cat sleep, Victor sleep, even the cockroaches sleep. But when I closed my eyes, sleep did not come. That\u2019s how I suspected I had died. \n\n\u201cWe will travel,\u201d he said to me, \u201cWe will see the world. We will do all the things we said we would do together.\u201d\n\nBut I remembered very little of what we had said we would do together. I remembered glimpses, here and there, of light, of a book curled up on my lap, his unruly brown hair leaning against my knee. I remembered that. But I did not remember who he was. In fact, I did not remember who I had been or any others I had known. Glimpses visited, detached visions of faces flitting past like the shadows that danced on the walls from the candlelight. The faces scurried through my mind like insects across the walls, and told me I had had a mother, a father, a brother who died young. But as to what memories we had shared together\u2013those things were missing. My ability to speak remained intact, as did my knowledge of how basic physics worked in the world. But so much more was missing.\n\n\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cMany years,\u201d he said. He said he had found the secret to immortality. And then he had come for me, frozen in my cryogenic slumber. He would give me what he had found for himself, that which had come after my time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you remember,\u201d he said. \u201cJust give me a chance.\u201d\n\nSo I did. We traveled the world, my face hidden by a veil. We saw a great many things, from the icy cliffs of the North to the humid jungle tropics of the South. Alligators basking in rivers, lions in a hunt, a flock of flamingos darkening the sun. We saw them all, and more.\n\nBut still I was unmoved. I felt nothing. Saw nothing. Everything felt as cold and far away as the moon. Even the kisses that he lavished upon me.\n\n\u201cTake me back,\u201d I said, finally. \n\nResigned, he took me back to the house, and prepared a fluid that would slow the beating of my heart.\n\nThat\u2019s when he gave me a kiss, on my lips. He never cared that I now looked different. Again I remembered the book on my lap, the light, his hair upon my knee. I still could not feel what he said I once had felt. But I felt something now, like a small nudge of warmth. I kissed him back.\n\n\u201cThank you for trying,\u201d I said. \u201cI loved you, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you still,\u201d he said, and injected the solution into my arm.", "ups": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Speculative Fiction", "title": "An Old Friend", "text": "The door knob twisted silently. The only thing that told the room's occupant that it had moved was the small click of the latch. The door, swinging open, moved just as quietly. A tall, pale, man entered the small room. The heels of his boots echoing on the tiled floor.\n\nThe occupant, Darius, looked up at the footsteps. It was different from the soft beeping of the heart monitor to his right. His wrinkled hands shook as he closed the book he had been reading. He shifted slightly allowing him to sit up higher in his bed.\n\nThis visit was expected. He had been waiting for it ever since he entered the hospital.\n\nThe Man before him was exceptionally well dressed. A tailored three piece suit, black, covered his thin frame. A silver chain led from one pocket to under his suit jacket. He had a long overcoat, also black, draped over his left arm. In his right hand he held a cane. It was long to match his height, and it had an elongated, sharply curved handle running parallel to the floor. His face was smooth skinned with no beard or mustache. The brim of his hat covered his eyes as he looked over his cane.\n\n\"So you have finally come for me,\" Darius spoke. His voice, once deep and robust, was now thin and frail.\n\nThe Man looked up. Black eyes focused on him. He missed a breath. Those eyes were fathomless, and old. They had seen things he couldn't imagine, and now they were trained on him.\n\n\"You can see me?\" The Man asked. His voice was smooth and carried supreme confidence. Despite the surprise his statement implied, his face showed none of the emotion. He seemed more curious than anything.\n\nIt was the first time Darius had ever heard him speak, but it was not the first time he had seen him.\n\n\"Yes I can. I have my whole life,\" he replied. Reaching over he laid his book on the small bedside table. It rocked every so slightly on its wheels as he touched it.\n\n\"Interesting.\"\n\nSilence fell between the two. The only sound filling the room was the steady rhythm of the heart monitor. He didn't know what else to say, and the Man seemed content in his silence.\n\nDarius thought back. Back to the first times he saw the Man, or at least the first time he remembered. The sterile smell of the hospital room faded; the musty smell of an old trailer house filled his nose.\n\nHis mother had been passed out in her room; sleeping off whatever she had gotten high on. He had been left to fix the little food that was left in the house, and could be cooked by an eleven year old. His younger brother and sister waited eagerly at the table for the boiled potatoes he had managed to make. Having saved a few for his mother, he brought a plate back to her room. There before him was his mom, foam on her lips, unmoving on her bed. Standing over her was a tall thin man. He looked from his mother to the Man then back to his mother. The lights flickered, and the intruder was gone. He dropped the food, rushing to his mother. Screaming her name and shaking her arm. She didn\u2019t wake up.\n\nFrom then on he could always see the Man around in seemingly random places: on a busy intersection, standing outside a house, or waiting at a construction site. It was years before he had another direct run in.\n\nAfter his mother was gone, the three children had moved in with their father. He had enjoyed the government check he got for them as much as their mother had. Finally he was able to afford all the booze he wanted to drink, and drink he did.\n\nAt the age of fifteen the Man had visited Darius' house once more. This time to see his father who had spent the last few days on a bender. The Man had walked straight past the front door and behind the children. Darius had looked up from the TV to watch him go by.\n\nHe stood to follow, but couldn't make his legs move. Something about the Man's back, retreating from him, told him not to go. His brother and sister didn't seem to notice; the cartoons were too interesting. He sat back down on the faded couch slowly as a door in the hallway closed.\n\nThe three had been moved into foster care the next day.\n\nIt was around that time that Darius was old enough to figure out what he was seeing. What the Man meant. From that point on anytime he saw him, he turned and went the other way. Running from what he knew he was seeing.\n\nThe Man visited more than a few of his neighbors. He clocked out early when his workplace received a visit; that place had been shut down shortly after and he had to find a new job. When his sister had followed in their mother's footsteps; ending up in the hospital for her drug of choice. The Man had come to visit. He had seen him enter his sister's room. To his shame, fear overwhelmed him. He couldn't bring himself to enter his sister's room. He stood in the middle of the hall staring at the door as the alarms started blaring. Only moving when a nurse pulled him aside as doctors tried to rush around him. The Man visited his friends, his family, and even his late wife. Now he was visiting him.\n\nDarius came back to the present. The hospital smell returned. The clock showed only seconds had passed. The Man was still standing before him; a pleased smile on his face.\n\n\"Many who meet me have their lives flash before their eyes. I try to give them time to process it,\" the Man's voice filled the silence.\n\n\"I feared you,\" he began. Ignoring the statement. \"I did everything in my power to avoid you.\"\n\n\"That is very common.\"\n\n\"Then I hated you.\"\n\n\"That is also very common,\" that statement carried a hint of dejection.\n\n\"I hated you for what you took from me: my mother, my father, my family, my wife. I spent almost all of my years believing you were evil.\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"And now,\" Darius sighed. \"Now I believe you were there to give them peace. To lead them to the other side.\"\n\nThe Man's face seemed to brighten.\n\n\"Never did I think to meet someone who could see me,\" the Man said. \"Let alone one so understanding.\"\n\n\"Do I have time to call my children before you take me?\"\n\nThe Man pulled on the chain coming from his pocket. A watch appeared. With a press of a finger it opened and he examined it.\n\n\"Unfortunately, no,\" the Man apologized before making a suggestion. \"If you want more time you can always challenge me to a game of your choice.\"\n\n\"No, it's okay. I am ready.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" the Man approached. His footsteps echoed loudly over the floor. When he reached the bed he moved his cane to his left and reached out. \"For what it is worth I am sorry.\"\n\n\"It's okay old friend.

The days when the climate was habitable before climate change before you had to wear an oxygen mask and tank on your back just to breathe oxygen. Now there was nothing special about earth it was a planet among all the others just another lifeless planet. \n\nEventually, I landed on Pluto and began to drill through the ice when the drill had drilled 500ft there was liquid water. I rejoiced at the fact that there was hope however, it was only a puddle of liquid water. I quickly collected the water and went back to the shuttle. \n\nUpon returning to the station I gabbed the sample of water and put it in a storage compartment for Jack to collect and I had a moment of realization when jack said \n\n\u201cAmelia what have you done.

Occurring so rapidly I don't even get a chance to respond, though knowing it has something to do with this curse, I turn off my phone and then turn on the radio, attempting to drown out the swirling thoughts racing my mind.\n\nOn the local top 40 station, I hear my name, I stare at the radio for a moment, shaking my head. I turn up the volume to find I\u2019ve gone viral, yet I haven't posted anything in weeks. They announce today to be the official \u201cSeymour Adoration Day\u201d. I yell every curse word that comes to mind, slam my palm on the steering wheel, then turn off the radio.

It didn\u2019t last long as I toss and turn all night long.\n\nThe next day I head back to the Bartholomew\u2019s store bright and early.

Tomorrow was her Silencing ceremony, and she was beyond excited, but, well, also nervous.\n\nOnce she returned from the clinic, she would have lost the power of speech.\n\nOf course, it was partially symbolic, she would still be able to communicate through writing and typing, obviously. And she would still go to school, become educated and have a career- in fact her occupation profile was finalized- she would become a software engineer, and as of next term, she would be studying programming almost exclusively. Occupational profiles had to be finalized before the Silencing, in case there were women with exceptional singing voices who would be allowed to keep their vocal chords and join the entertainment industry.

She had the most beautiful dress \u2013 everybody had been dressed beautifully, as a matter of fact, the food had been amazing, and a special group of Singers had been hired for live entertainment. It had been a truly incredible experience. What with Dad\u2019s high-paid job as Teacher, money had never been an issue for them.\n\nEliza had wanted to become a Teacher, like her Dad. She had grown up watching him prepare lesson plans, grade assignments with his thick chunky red pens, discussing course content and pedagogy with his colleagues loudly and passionately. She was enthralled by it all and knew, as indeed her Dad told her, there was actually nothing more noble and worthwhile than teaching and shaping the mind of the young. No wonder only men were entrusted to be Teachers.

She understood why it was necessary. Dad had explained it all carefully: the history, the benefits to society, the evolution from a symbolic tattoo along the throat, to an actual, painless clinical procedure which disabled the vocal chords of women permanently. She was lucky she had a Teacher Dad who took the time to explain things so beautifully to her- others would usually just get an official brochure with the date and time of their Silencing appointment, although schools sometimes included educational material on Silencing. However, as Dad said, it was very important that it was taught correctly, with proper context, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be understood properly. That\u2019s why Teaching was such an important job.\n\nIt didn\u2019t used to be like that, in the bad old days, when women jabbered, chattered, gossiped, wheedled, manipulated men and told stories and yammered and protested and wanted this and that and the other- society had been always in chaos then.\n\nEliza was so happy she lived now, and not in those old days.", "ups": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Speculative Fiction", "title": "Cloudy With a Chance of Human Bodies", "text": "It was a normal old regular type of day. People got up and made breakfast, some tiptoed around the house to avoid waking their kids too early, coffee was poured, and eyes were wiped clean of sleep dust. In the streets, car engines purred as the early morning rush hour began and shop owners turned their closed signs around to open. It was a regular morning, except if you found the raining bodies to be an issue.\n\nWhen the familiar grey clouds started to loom overhead people knew what was coming. Soon bodies would begin to pour down onto rooftops, sidewalks, and even the roads. Depending on the surface, they would land with either a splat or a giant crunch, but either way, the noise was always present. But of course, gloomy weather was an expected part of life and people trudged on with their day without the warming presence of the sun. Naturally, this would cause some minor changes that needed to be made. \n\nThe blood was easy, the power-washer cars would soon be out to clean up the scarlet sludge as soon as the storm was over just like a snowplough after a blizzard. The bodies posed more of a threat, driving over them was bumpy and could cause serious damage to any ordinary vehicle. Not to mention the huge amount of damage that was posed by a body crash landing on the roof of a car or heaven forbid a windshield. It was clear that something needed to be done, and many businesses claimed they had the perfect solution.\n\nBoulet Inc. was one of the first big companies to put out a potential solution to some of the issues caused by raining bodies. This life-saving product was creatively called The Boulet Inc. Deluxe Frontal Clearer but would soon come to be nicknamed by the general public as \u201cBuzzsaw Bumpers.\u201d This extension of the car's front would conveniently chop away at any stray body that crossed the path of the vehicle making travel much easier in stormy conditions. At first, consumers were not extremely thrilled with the idea of ground-beefing human beings, but as there was no alternative on the market at the time, sales soon began to skyrocket.\n\nSeeing the lucrative business opportunities other companies started to jump into the market. Raymond Car Automotive acted fast and patented a design of a reinforced car hull. It would become a must-have for all future carmakers and would be remembered for its signature catchphrase of \u201cA Raymond Body for Raining Bodies!\u201d\n\nMany more products were soon put to line, some caught on like wildfire while others sank into obscurity. Things like Wendy\u2019s Reinforced Windshield Wipers, Fred\u2019s Friendlier Sunroof, and the Disturbing Sound Muffler were all enormous hits. While things like Double Blade Wheels, The Body Net, and the infamous Human Funnel failed to find their niche.\n\nWhile the thought of hundreds to thousands of human bodies occasionally crashing down on the world may seem like it would be considered mostly a negative thing, some positives come from it. New jobs were opened up and people were able to find new employment as body cleaners and bodily-rooftop disposal men. Builders and construction workers saw a big upswing in work when the new laws called for every building to have a cover walkway installed so that people exiting their cars wouldn\u2019t have to worry about being crushed by the weather. Still, though, one can\u2019t help but wonder what life was like before the bodies started to rain.\n\nI hear it caused quite the ruckus when it first started happening. There was mass panic, which is funny to think about due to how ordinary and common it is now. Scientists, doctors, politicians, and everyone was rushing to figure out why the \u2018freak events\u2019 were happening and how to stop them. At first, it was assumed that it was some freak act of terrorism and fingers got pointed in all directions, but mostly at Russia. After that was eventually ruled out, theories started popping up everywhere. A popular one was that all the bodies were just people from the future trying to perfect going back in time and failing miserably. It was a fun thought, but science showed that it was directly tied to some drastic change in the weather. Of course, we know that they never figured it out, and likely never will, but I hear some are still trying to put an end to it. \n\nCrime rates went unpleasantly low, which is something that is not normally said. Normally low crime rates have a good connotation, but not when bodies are falling out of the sky. It became slowly clear how easy it was to get away with a crime when it happened to be a rainy day. *Murder someone?* Just throw them in the street and wait for the cleanup crew to arrive. *How did they die?* A body fell on them. *Where\u2019s the evidence?* Try getting a blood sample with the flood of it in the street. Over time this was just something people would have to accept would happen, and soon that became shockingly easy.\n\nPeople grew accustomed to the occasional crunch or splat, kids would play count the bodies on a long ride home from school, and some extremists tried to draw attention to the possibility of using the spare \u2018meat\u2019 as an alternative to other animal products. It would cut costs and even potentially carbon emissions caused by giant cow farms and such. But this was ultimately struck down for the obvious reason- the mega-corporations running the meat industry wouldn\u2019t allow it. However other uses for spare human parts were found.\n\nWhen a body would fall on a soft spot or some other lucky space, it was natural that its inner parts would go to some use. After all, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re using their vital organs anymore. Hearts, kidneys, livers and many more essential organs were all put to good use. Waiting lists became shorter and lives became longer, it would seem that this raining body thing was a splendid thing to happen after all.\n\nIt's funny, it\u2019s strange to think of a world where this didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s become so normal to everyday life that the dead stare on every splattering body is as remarkable as the lines on the road. Of course, there a times when I wonder, times when I lay awake at night and get a dreadful feeling that something isn\u2019t right, but over time that feeling fades. It\u2019s okay to have doubts about the world you live in, it\u2019s only natural. But ultimately, it\u2019s only cloudy with a chance of human bodies.", "ups": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.86}, {"genre": "Romance", "title": "\u201cMy Night with my Bestfriend\u2019s Girlfriend\u201d Written By: MyBiography Romance", "text": "\nAshley and I were both 16 years old at the time and I had just gotten my license. Bobby (her boyfriend of 1 year and my bestfriend of 10 years) was still stuck inside on House Arrest; finishing up his sentence from when we got arrested a few months earlier. I always respected that Bobby took the brunt of the blame for our arrests; even though we were both equally quilty (story for another time). But since he couldn\u2019t leave his house, Ashley and I started spending more and more time together by default. As the days turned into weeks, our harmless outings to the corner store or the mall; quickly turned into dinners and movies. There was no denying it...I was starting to fall for my bestfriend\u2019s girlfriend. \n\nThen, on one fall night when the sky was especially clear, Ashley suggested that we take a blanket and go lay out behind the school\u2019s football field and watch the stars. Even though I knew it wasn\u2019t right, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to try and convince her otherwise. So there we layed...in a blanket...under the stars while we laughed and talked for hours. I kept telling myself that it was all normal and that I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. I had to...otherwise I would have had to end whatever you would call \u201cus\u201d and come clean to Bobby.\n\nI can\u2019t remember who finally suggested that we should pack up the blankets first; but we did, and decided to go pick up some friends (Tommy and Stacey) of ours. We didn\u2019t have any major plans, we all just basically drove around in my car smoking, laughing and listening to music. By the time it got to 1:00 AM, Tommy and Stacey were ready to call it a night but Ashley was still going strong. She made a joke that she wished that the night didn\u2019t have to end and that we could drive around all night. One thing led to another until she ultimately suggested that we spend the night in my car...In my car? Almost without hesitation I said let\u2019s do it! Again, telling myself that this was all completely normal behavior between a friend and his best friend\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nAfter I dropped off Tommy and Stacey, I drove around with Ashley for a few more hours; having the time of our lives. Later on, we got food from a local diner and decided to pull into a park just before sunrise. Ashley suggested that we get the blanket that we had used in the field earlier and stretch out in the back seat. Once again there we were...under a blanket...in the backseat of my car watching the stars turn into a sunrise.\n\nTruth be told, that\u2019s where the story ends. There was no passionate kiss or expressing of feelings. Maybe deep down I didn\u2019t want to lose my friendship with Bobby, maybe I was just to scared to make the first move; but it all just ended as quickly as it began some 15 hours or so earlier. I remember the feeling after I dropped Ashley off at her house (the house that I would be sneaking out of a few months later). I remember feeling like she was \u201cthe one\u201d for me. Who else could I flow conversation with so easily, who else had a laugh like hers, who else had a face like hers?

Tobias thought this was unfair and threatened to make Ines' life a living hell if she didn't make a deal. She did, and they would become separate but equal King and Queen. They would each have a say in decisions, but if they disagreed, they would defer to the military's top commander, Zanzibar, who Ines knew was in love with her. Tobias had been duped, and the coronation was held with a tie-breaker that would never go in his favor.\n\nDespite their efforts to ensure equality in appearance, wealth, and decision-making, the residents of their Kingdom preferred Ines and recognized her as the true Queen of the Kingdom. The military also gave Ines greater respect than Tobias, believing that Ines made better decisions than her brother. Finally, Tobias became bitter and earned a reputation as useless, lazy, and just symbolic figurehead.\n\nTobias was consumed by jealousy. He stole half of the Kingdom's wealth and departed one day after being overruled for the hundredth time. Tobias spent ten years traveling the world in search of the most powerful mystics, psychics, and alchemists. If he ever came home, he would do so as the most powerful person in history.\n\nTobias eventually found a witch who wielded the darkest magic. He had nearly spent the entire Kingdom's wealth in order to find this witch. Since he was out of money, he offered his soul to the witch in return for immortality, uncountable wealth, and supreme power.\n\n\"How will I collect your soul if you are immortal?\" The witch asked.\n\nTobias sensed he was getting close, and as he gazed around the witch's cave, he noticed a ladybug climbing up a rock.\n\n\"Fine, the only element on Earth capable of killing me will be a ladybug.\"\n\nThe witch thought about it for a minute before agreeing.\n\n\"Alright, when you are killed because of a ladybug, I will collect your soul.\"\n\nShe cast a spell, and Tobias became all-powerful.\n\nHe returned directly from the witch's cave to his home Kingdom, marched right into the Palace, and killed Queen Ines with lightning from his hands in a demonstration of supreme might. The Kingdom cowered in fear and lamented the loss of their beloved Queen.\n\nTobias ascended to the throne as the lone and invincible King. He had finally seized control of the Kingdom's money, military, and citizens.\n\nTobias' first act as King was to assign Zanzibar and some of his higher-ranking military operatives the mission of gathering and destroying all ladybugs throughout the Kingdom and beyond.\n\nTobias took up residence within the Palace while his orders were being carried out, refusing to leave or even address his subjects.\n\nIt took years, but Zanzibar and the Kingdom's troops were eventually able to destroy every ladybug in the Kingdom and beyond. When Zanzibar returned to the Palace to inform the King that they had completed their job successfully, Tobias killed them as well because they were aware of his weakness.\n\nHowever, the King was unaware that Zanzibar carried a grudge against him because he had murdered the love of his life. He wasn't sure why the King was scared of ladybugs, so he trapped one remaining in a metal sphere and buried it beneath the Palace. \n\nBefore his untimely death, the only person he told about the sealed ladybug was his daughter, whom he told in a bedtime story. The plot revolved around an all-powerful King who was terrified of ladybugs. And how the King murdered all of the ladybugs except one, which an enemy placed under his throne.\n\nHis daughter, on the other hand, saw it as nothing more than a ridiculous story and never believed it to be true.\n\nKing Tobias emerged from the Palace, knowing that all of his weaknesses had been eliminated, and ruled his Kingdom with an iron fist. The King was not content with simply dominating over his subjects; he also invaded other Kingdoms, establishing an Empire of terror that stretched beyond the horizon.\n\nThe King was the most despised man in the Empire, yet he was immortal, all-powerful, and had amassed a tremendous military force to enforce his reign. Despite multiple assassination attempts, his adversaries quickly discovered that no one could kill him. After years of fighting an uphill battle against an insurmountable opponent, a covert resistance had developed, but their numbers began to wane.\n\nZanzibar's daughter would carry on the legacy of the buried ladybug by telling her children, who would then tell their children, and so on for decades.\n\nThe amusing story of the buried ladybug became widely known. People liked to relate the story of King Tobias, who was scared of ladybugs, because he was so despised in the Kingdom. It was the only way the common man could get even with the merciless King.\n\nYears and years later, the resistance had devolved into a grave situation. Only a few resistance fighters remained as King Tobias closed in. Even though they knew it was merely an old wives' story, they wondered if the ladybug sealed beneath the King's throne represented a hidden weakness or a unique allergy.\n\nWhile the King was out tormenting the people of another kingdom, they began to dig beneath the throne using basically their last remaining resources. They dug and dug till they came across a metal sphere. Four of the remaining five resistance fighters were killed getting this metal sphere out of the Palace.\n\nThe last resistance fighter tried for months to crack open the metal sphere until it finally cracked open like an egg. Inside was a tiny shriveled-up ladybug. He looked back in awe; the story was true. But what would he do with a dead ladybug?\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to oust the terrible King, the resistance fighter broke into the Palace and planned to place the ladybug inside the King's food. The resistance fighter, on the other hand, was apprehended and imprisoned with the ladybug in his pocket.\n\nBecause this was the last resistance fighter in his kingdom, the King personally went down to murder him. As the King entered the cell, the resistance fighter backed up against a wall.\n\n\"Do you know how long I've been waiting to finally eliminate the resistance?\"\n\nThe King gently raised his hands to shoot lightning from his palms at the fighter. The desperate resistance fighter grabbed the ladybug from his pocket and flung it on the ground in front of the King. As the wind blew, the ladybug looked to move on its own.\n\nThe King was taken aback! He became terrified and began to back away from the ladybug, as if a ghost had materialized out of thin air. As he began to go backward, the King stumbled over a raised stone and fell against the wall, breaking his neck.\n\nDespite the fact that the ladybug was dead and did not touch him, the King died as a result of a ladybug. The King's weakness was ultimately realized. The witch had now taken possession of the King's soul.\n\nThe King was confronted by all the victims he had killed, including Ines, Zanzibar, several resistance fighters, and his parents, whom he had murdered in the middle of the night in order to seize power.\n\n\"When you rule with an iron fist, the smallest things are the most difficult to control.\"", "ups": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.85}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "Target Locked: Pending Approval", "text": "MENTAL OPTIMIZATION BUREAU\n\nNEW SUBJECT INTAKE INTERVIEW\n\nSUBJECT GLOBAL ID: 423241969\n\nAUTOMATED MENTOR SERIAL NUMBER: 86574-UTV\n\nDate: 7-19-2099\n\nM: \u201cHello, please take a seat.\u201d\n\nS: \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nM: \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\n\nS: \u201cMy heart rate was spiking at work yesterday.

Humanity had begun using direct signals instead of less efficient broad signals, so this planet would never see us unless we called out to them.\n\nWe learned that they called themselves the Dukra, and they were so full of hope for their future. Their solar system had 7 planets, 4 of which were rocky, and 2 of which showed signs of liquid water. Being that they were 110 light years away, our first message would not reach them for 110 years, and it would take 220 years before we would hear a response. Researchers developed a message that would be easy for a younger civilization to translate, and then, using a powerful radio beam, our message was sent in their direction. Humanity sat by, waiting for a reply while they watched this new civilization grow. They listened to the transmissions, which weren't always peaceful, but it was clear this species was doing the best they could. The news was regularly flooded with images from this new world, amazing sights with glowing blue animals, purple plants, and a red sun which appeared large in their light orange sky. Their people were also much different from humans. They had tentacles reaching out from all sides which would allow them to roll instead of walking like a human, and the tip of each tentacle had a fluff of fur which protected their skin from the ground. We don't know much about their senses, but our researchers know that they can see and hear because their transmissions include audio, video, and another stream of data which hasn't yet been decoded. Some believe we haven't decoded this data, because we lack a sense that this data carries, we don\u2019t know what that sense could be, so the researchers are unsure how to translate it.\n\nAfter watching their civilization grow for 98 years, their high pitch guinea pig-like voices became normal to us, and it felt as though they were already close friends. We knew much about them and their civilization, and we saw a lot of similarities between us and them, but we also saw a gradual increase in their hostility. It seemed that many in this civilization disagreed with the aggression, but a tipping point had been reached, and a few that held power were determined to fight. The dam of peace had been broken, and with it, the waters of war rushed forth. With the vastness of space on their doorstep, instead of claiming land on other worlds, the Dukra chose to fight their own kind for small patches of land on their planet.\n\nWith the signal delay, this war had happened 110 years before we were seeing it, so our scientists could do nothing to help them. As we waited and watched, the radio signals from this planet rapidly lit up with images of our fluffy tentacle friends lying on the ground in pools of their own dark green blood. The organic buildings they constructed lay in piles of rubble while explosions blast around them. Chaos was now all that they knew.\n\nWe wanted to tell them that this universe held more than they could possibly imagine, we wanted to guide them to reignite the hope that we once saw in them, but our message would need 12 more years to reach them. Their weapons grew stronger as their population weakened. It was clear that they had fallen far from hope. Three years after the chaos began, it ended. There were a few more passing signals until 2243, but they contained only audio, no more video or third signal.\n\nThe spectral imaging of their atmosphere showed that the elements they exhale had vanished. They were gone now, and in 2250, our message fell on a dead world. Once again, humanity was alone in the cosmic darkness.\n\nWe had stored all of the recordings from that time, and although our friends were gone, human researchers continued to study this data. They learned that the Dukra would vibrate a certain frequency depending on their emotions. The third signal contained this emotion vibration data. They would gently shake with joy, and vibrate faster with fear. In the end, when the bombs were being dropped, they were all very afraid. The only ones without fear were their leaders. They had undoubtedly seen the videos of their wars, and felt the fear of their people. And although they had seen the pain and destruction they were causing, they still chose to continue. The emotional signals from their leaders showed greed, lust, and confidence. They continued to fight, because they believed there was a chance they could win, but it's impossible to win when you're fighting yourself.", "ups": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Thriller", "title": "Curse of Consciousness ", "text": "An alarm screeches as a boy groans at the thought of another day of thoughts. The boy reluctantly gets out of bed to a particularly bland world. Thoughts of everything that could go wrong rush the boy\u2019s head as he gets ready for school. While he\u2019s getting ready, the boy notices his house is unusually empty but he assumes everyone left early.\n\nThe boy grabs his favorite cereal only to notice it doesn\u2019t taste as good as he remembers. Puzzled, the boy assumes the cereal is out of date.\u00a0 The boy is then washed over by a\u00a0 strange wave of deja vu but chooses to ignore it as he doesn\u2019t know why or where it came from. As the boy gets ready to walk to school, he puts in his earbuds and puts on his favorite song just to get annoyed by how repetitive and boring it now seems to sound.\u00a0 The boy also realized that the world which used to be vibrant and beautiful has now turned an ugly shade of gray. He ignores it as it\u2019s been a constant trend for once beautiful things to turn gray and depressing. The boy then turns his music up and makes his way to school, head down, kicking rocks, trying to distract himself from invading thoughts and the sad, monotonous reality of his daily life.\u00a0\n\nAs he walks, he notices the air has a strange scent like it\u2019s about to rain but he sees no clouds and the sky is strangely gray.\u00a0 While walking, the boy looks up and sees an odd shape in the road ahead, while all these abnormal experiences keep happening he realizes he hasn\u2019t seen a single car or another person. As he approaches the strange shape he saw he can feel the air gradually get colder and the world around him starts to get darker.\u00a0\n\nWhen the boy gets close enough he can see that the shape is missing\u00a0 a hexagon-shaped section in the road, seemingly leading to nothing. The hole doesn\u2019t seem to have much below it either as if it was just a tile of the world that has been removed. The sight of the hole heightens the boy\u2019s senses allowing him to notice the slight but constantly increasing distortion in his music but not the sounds of the rest of the world as there is no sound other than the music coming from his earbuds, not even his footsteps. Realizing this, the boy screams in an attempt to make any noise other than the now extremely distorted music coming from his headphones.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0In an attempt to pause or somehow stop the music, the boy rips out the cords leading to his earbuds but that doesn\u2019t stop it. The boy then scratches at his ears to make the noises he once called music stop. His earbuds fall to the ground not making a sound but the music continues playing.\u00a0\n\nTerrified, the boy sprints from the ungodly hole as to make it stop. The more he distances himself from the hole, the more he can hear. First, his heart pounding in his chest. Then, his breathing which is heavy and ragged. Finally, his feet stomping on the asphalt road. The boy is petrified but works up the courage to look back. As he does, he sees more hexagon-shaped holes appear, swallowing buildings whole, buildings where loved ones lived, buildings where he had many great memories, buildings where he met friends and spent time with family. The boy keeps running, as a single tear rolls down his cheek, quickly swept away by the wind that is now raging around him. Lightning crashes and thunder booms but still nothing in the sky, not even a cloud, still a constant gray except for the occasional flash of white in place of lightning.\u00a0\n\nStill looking back at the destruction behind him, the boy is hit with another wave of deja vu, forcing him to whip his head back to see where he\u2019s going. When his eyes focus on the path ahead the boy realizes there is none. Nothing. Everything ahead of him is gone, swallowed into the ever-growing void that\u2019s spreading like a plague, consuming everything he loved. Cornered inches from falling into the dark abyss, the boy looks back to where he just ran from, seeing he doesn\u2019t have much time left as the unexplainable corruption spreads closer to him. Realizing he has nowhere to go, the boy closes his eyes, calms his breathing, and relaxes his body.\n\nWith the boy\u2019s body at ease, he is allowed to have a free mind and think. The boy thinks for what feels like years, decades, centuries, almost like a meditative state. A constant stream of thoughts, unbroken and never wavering. Thoughts of life, past traumas, horrors from his childhood, but they weren\u2019t all bad. The boy also thought back to the great times with friends and family, not many but golden moments. At that moment, the boy knew what he had to do. As he opened his eyes, he saw every single moment he just thought about suspended in the air on geometric platforms, scattered in the newly formed void. Every good and bad moment in his life was displayed in front of him.\u00a0\n\nA small gap in the chaos appeared ahead of him, clarity and freedom from his past that haunts him. The boy took one more deep breath and sprinted full speed at the gap, faster than he\u2019s ever run. While running, the platforms containing his past, that shaped him, that made him who he is today, start blinking out of existence. As he reaches the end of what\u2019s left of his world, he sees only one platform, positioned right in front of him. A pill bottle with a weathered label, all he can read from it is the letters, \u201cZol..\u201d.\u00a0\n\nThe boy couldn\u2019t make out any more from it as he had to look at the ground beneath him and the edge rapidly approaching. When the boy reaches the edge, time seems to stop for just a moment as he is blasted by emotions. Anger, fear, joy, sadness, disgust, all felt in a split second and quickly fading. No longer being bound by feelings or memories, the boy leaps into the void. While he\u2019s falling, the boy feels nothing but is overwhelmed by a feeling he never felt before,\u00a0 an unexplainable feeling of freedom from the stress and pressure of life. Finally free, finally at peace. As the rest of the world fades and the boy falls into the endless abyss, darkness envelops his vision until he can no longer see anything but pitch black.\n\nThen as if nothing happened, the boy opens his eyes, back in bed, back in his house, back in the same old world he left the night before.\u00a0 He thinks to himself,\u201d Ugh, another one, must\u2019ve forgot my pills last night.\u201d The boy then reaches over to his bedside table and grabs a pill bottle with a weathered label. As he takes the pill, he looks out his window. Just as he swallows the pill, the world brightens and becomes almost over saturated in color. Also in the back of his mind, another hexagon-shaped hole evaporates leaving a hopeless void in its place.

If it\u2019s on your windshield, a little fluid and a couple scrubs from your wipers will clear it off. Anywhere else on the car and you either have to wash it off yourself, wait for rain or take it through a car wash. It\u2019s a minor inconvenience at worst. But what if the bird poop literally buried your car like a snow storm. You can\u2019t take that through a car wash because you can\u2019t even get inside your car. Not that you can even approach your car when the poop is also on fire. This is what happens when you live next to a wizard who breeds Phoenixes. \n\nIn stories, a Phoenix is supposed to bring good luck or help people, but these ones just fly around and annoy everyone like pigeons. They like to perch on top of everyone\u2019s house and it's hard not to be worried that one day the roof would cave in because of it. I didn\u2019t know Phoenixes even grew that large. \n\nWhen it comes to dealing with a problem like this there are a few options. All of which I\u2019ve tried. \n\nThe first is to talk to the neighbor. \n\nI knocked on his door and he answered. The wizard was what you would expect an old wizard to look like. Gray beard, robes, a pointed hat, he had everything. Of course I was angry, but I tried to be civil. I asked him if he could try and keep the birds away from my house or keep them under control and he made an excuse about how the Phoenixes are their own creatures and go wherever the wind takes them. I then asked if at the very least he could use some kind of magic spell to clean my car. He merely laughed and told me that magic doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nThe next step was to take up my concerns with the local ruling bodies. Since this was a magic related issue I had to go talk to the council. Unlike normal people whose buildings look like modern structures, the magic council\u2019s building looks like an old tower. Everything else is like normal government procedures. In order to make my complaint, I have to make an appointment. The soonest they could see me was in about two weeks, or as they said for dramatic effect, a fortnight. \n\nThey told me they would contact me when they were ready to see me. What they didn\u2019t tell me is that when the council was ready I would be teleported from wherever I was. When it happened, I was at work, and I was using the bathroom. It scared the literal crap out of me. Luckily, the teleportation spell worked as a tunnel so I had time to at least zip up my pants. When I finally saw the council, which was a group of old men in women in robes, they said that Phoenix breeding wasn\u2019t illegal, so they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. When they teleported me back to work, they brought me back to the exact place they had taken me, and somebody else was already in the stall. \n\nThe final step was to take matters into my own hands. I was a hunter, and I had a collection of rifles. If none of the wizards would take care of the Phoenixes, then I would. At least if one landed on my house. One did, which was signaled by the loud thud which shook the house and knocked off some ornaments from my shelves. I took my best rifle and went outside. My goal was to scare off the beast. I aimed at it, but a couple feet away so the bullet would pass it\u2019s head. As I fired, the bird turned it\u2019s head and the bullet struck it right in the eye. I freaked out because I thought I had just killed the Phoenix and then the wizard would take his revenge on me. \n\nWhat I had forgotten was that when a Phoenix dies, it burns up and revives itself from the ashes. This is indeed what happened, however in the ensuing rebirth, the fire took my house with it. When it was over, I threw my gun down, sat on the sidewalk and cried. \n\nAfter everything, most people would pack up what they could and either stay with a friend or family member, or get a hotel room. But I couldn\u2019t do either, because my car was still covered in flaming Phoenix poop.

He is a magician and lives alone in a cooperative housing society. He is sitting on his couch and playing with his mobile. On TV, the news appears that a thief has escaped from the jail and is on the run from the police. Suddenly, someone knocks on his door. Harry opens it. He sees the same thief.\n\nAt 10:40 AM, The police who were chasing the thief reached the housing society. Inspector Ramesh talks to the secretary of the housing society who informs them that the watchman is on a leave and there are no security cameras in the building. However, police find a CCTV camera in the street outside the housing society. The footage shows the thief entering the housing society. The police check the whole place. They go inside every house and search for the thief. No one opens Harry's house when the police knock. The police get suspicious and break open the door.\u00a0\n\nAt 10:50 AM, they enter the house and see Harry tied and gagged in a chair. The wardrobe in his bedroom is open. Harry tells Inspector Ramesh that the thief threatened him with a knife, tied him and stole 1.5 lakhs money that was in his wardrobe and left the house. Police then search outside in the streets but couldn't find the thief. The media mocks the police brutally.\n\n\u00a0At 2:00 PM, Inspector Ramesh is suspended as the thief escaped the jail while he was on duty and he failed in catching him. Later that day, Ramesh goes home and is very depressed. He locks himself in his room and keeps thinking about the case. He is very desperate to solve this crime. He remembers that the CCTV footage in the street showed the thief entering the housing society but not leaving it. He suspects that the thief is still in the housing society and most probably in Harry's house. He tries to know more about Harry through the internet. He finds out that Harry is an expert in Escapology. He is convinced that Harry is lying because he could have easily freed himself when the thief tied him. He also finds out that many of Harry's shows have been cancelled and he is not a very successful magician. He believes that Harry cannot possess 1.5 lakhs and he is lying.\n\n27th June 2020, 10:00 AM: Ramesh reports to his senior's office the next morning. He tries to convince him that Harry is lying. However, his senior Aakash rubbishes Ramesh's claims. Aakash tells him that Harry was tied by ropes instead of chains. He is only trained to free himself from chains with the help of a hook. Further, Harry was threatened by a knife. So it's possible he was nervous and couldn't free himself. Also, Harry has given a statement that he took a loan from a Government Bank for his next show and this has been confirmed by the Bank. This is how he had 1.5 lakhs in his wardrobe. Ramesh is told to leave the police office as he doesn't have any solid proof. He returns to his home as he had failed again.\u00a0\n\nThe case has been handed over to many officials. It has been shifted to many different departments. Many elaborate Inquiries and meetings to solve the crime have occurred. The\u00a0thief's associates were caught and interrogated. His bank accounts and cash withdrawal were traced. 'Wanted' posters for the thief have been circulated within the country and later to overseas countries too. Spies have been set on Harry. But all of that was a dead end.\u00a0\n\nIt's been a year. The search for the thief and money is still continuing and this has become one of the most discussed cases among the police, public and media and yet it is not solved. However, the secretary of the housing society is happy that the government installed CCTV cameras inside the building for free.\n\nIt turns out Harry got addicted to online gambling games during the lockdown and he lost a lot of money. He had taken a loan of 1.5 lakhs from the government bank but was unable to settle it as many of his shows were cancelled due to fear of the spread of the virus. Harry killed the thief the day he saw him and hid him behind a mirror in his bedroom. The mirror was one of his artefacts that he regularly uses in his magic shows. He then opened the wardrobe door, tied and gagged himself and feigned a crime scene. The corpse of the thief still lies behind the mirror.\n\nThe case has made Harry very popular. Media had hailed him as a hero since according to them, he remained calm when the thief broke in. His debt is cleared because the government spared his loan as his money was stolen and couldn't be found by the police. He is now a successful magician, married and has two kids.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, Ramesh became addicted to alcohol. He was arrested for beating his wife and daughter.

The fading aroma of a Christmas ham intermingled with the alluring smell of freshly baked gingerbread cookies and filled every corner of the small lodge in the Montana wilderness.\n\nNelly and Brett had planned this getaway for months now. Years spent with their increasingly chaotic families left them yearning to find some peace for the holidays. They had both been smitten with the area surrounding Yellowstone after their honeymoon a few years prior, and decided this year to get away from the hustle and bustle of their daily lives in the DC metro area by returning to bring in the new year.\n\nThe couple, still well in the prime of their lives, had spent the first night, Christmas Eve, in each other\u2019s arms, finally able to relax and melt away the stress, sublimating into the deadened silence of the snow-covered countryside. Occasionally, the stillness would be shattered by the snapping of branches under the weight of snow and various calls from local wildlife. Which is why it was so concerning when Nelly and Brett heard footsteps squeaking through the snow.\n    \n\u201cShh. What is that?\u201d Nelly said, recoiling from Brett\u2019s embrace.

He swung his legs out of the bed and into his discarded Christmas-themed pajama pants. His feet, now freezing after being uncovered, quickly found the inside of his sherpa-lined slippers. Not bothering to find a shirt, the fleece lining of his leather jacket produced an unfamiliar feeling on his skin.\n    \nAs he stepped into the large common area of the cabin, reaching from the kitchen through the living area, he toggled the light-switches and illuminated the interior, hoping to disarm the source of the footsteps, acknowledging their presence.

His query was met with the same silence found before the footsteps which concerned him. Whoever it was had stopped moving and they did not reply to him.\n    \n\u201cIs that a Park Ranger out here?\u201d Brett called again. Once again he was met with utter silence. A breeze rose through the air, kicking up fresh powder from the ground and out of tree branches above. The cold wind painfully stung his face.\n    \n\u201cI\u2019m going back inside. If you\u2019re not a Park Ranger, please, just go away. We don\u2019t have cash or valuables, we\u2019re just here to relax.\u201d Brett said, bargaining with an unknown visitor with unknown intentions. He did as he said and returned to the warm embrace of the inside of the cabin with its glowing fire and seasonal aromatics, where his wife waited.\n    \nHe had no sooner reached the hall with the light switches when the electricity cut off entirely.

The door swung open wildly, carried, no doubt, by the wind on the snowy Chicago streets outside. Before me stood the most beautiful dame I\u2019d ever laid my eyes upon. Her face was sullen, and puffy, red eyes that had recently been crying hid behind a thin widow\u2019s veil.\n\nShe looked like she had walked right out of a really sad 1920\u2019s Jazz club. Her modest flapper dress, adorned with intricate art-deco inspired embroidery, hung around her like mourning to a mood. Short auburn hair twisted into a tight bun on the left side of her head, poking out just below the rim of her cloche hat. An intricate twist of intertwining silver strands clung closely to her neck.\n\n\u201cWell hello, madam.\u201d I said with a smile, straightening my coat as I rose to meet her.\n\n\u201cAre you Dickey McVeigh?\u201d She asked curtly.\n\n\u201cIndeed I am.

He picked up his picking orders for the next hour and grabbed a cart and scanner gun. A forklift was beeping across the warehouse. Derek hadn\u2019t flopped his arm around where his crotch was or grabbed for any crotches yet, but he was sweating. Four levels or temporary shelving stood over the aisles of the warehouse; it wasn\u2019t a claustrophobic space, but it had now windows. \n\n  The box of cat treats wasn\u2019t scanning when two of Edward\u2019s coworkers came down his aisle. He tried to avoid having social interaction at work; it diminished productivity. He also felt weird about having relationships with coworkers with whom he would have to share the fact that he hated the job which at this point the physical space they worked in was the only real personal link he had in common with them. They didn\u2019t mind him though, he thought. He thought he could feel that.

Derek always sprinted to work and wore the same sweats and was on caffeine and ephedrine at all hours of the shift for fat burning purposes.

I am proud of my record and will continue to strive for greatness.\" \n\nHis father, one of the respected Higher-ups, had started training his son earlier. \n\nA thing would be unheard of if he did not possess such a title. \n\nYet he did, and Jones developed quickly, outsmarting those in his schooling work.\n\nThis was a mistake. \n\nEveryone was equal here.\nEveryone had the same abilities. \nEveryone had the same opportunities. \nEveryone was the same. \n\nAnd so it was written on the front gates of Steel City, named after the ore it was built on. It stood great and proud, as if a concentration camp (although this was - of course - never discussed) exactly the same height as the other cities. \n\nThey had the exact same amount of letters. \n\nSaturn City. \nSpider City. \nSmiley City. \n\nAll had the same letter too. \n\nSo did the citizens. \n\nThere was John, Jenny, Junifer, Junior (although this one was looked down upon) and Jannet. \n\nAll the same. \n\nAll the same. \n\nYet Jones was different. Not that he liked to admit this fact to anyone. He seemed ordinary. Was ordinary in the eyes of all. Even his father. But he had one particular quirk that was undeniable\u2026 \n\n\u2026 He dreamt. \n\nDreaming was never discussed in Steel City, aside from the morning routine. It was prohibited, punishable even. \n\nNobody dared speak of imagination. \n\nHowever, Jones' father had made a mistake. A crucial mistake. He repeated sentences so much to poor Jones that he was bound to repeat them back, without questioning their meaning. \n\nOne day, at school, he had said the following, \"I'm starving.\" \n\nObviously, his teachers had scolded him, correcting him. \n\n\"You're not starving, God forbid, you're hungry. Repeat after me\u2026\" \n\nAnd so he did. \n\nEvery day. \n\nFor the rest of his life. \n\nUntil today. \n\n\n\nJones recalled the dream with a tinge of joy. He had been flying across the sky, the vast collage of blue his canvas. He would paint on it, his own presence. He towered above all others, and was the master of flight.\n\nHe was like a bird. \n\nFree from the compound and chains of life, the shackles of society. He was air-borne. \n\nOf course, he did not say these things to his father. To think of the shame! \n\nInstead, he finished his morning breakfast, and right on the chime of the bell that resounded across the city, he opened the door of his home. As did the rest of the citizens, perfectly on time. \n\nAside from one.\n\nOne dared disrupt the serenity of Steel City. \n\nImmediately, guards sprinted up to him, delivering a hasty blow to the head with a club. The man cried out, not used to the burning pain that now flooded across his body. \n\nAs was routine, all citizens nearby watched and egged the guards on. Shouts of, \"Get em!\" echoed across the town. It was the one time everyone was allowed to express the true nature of the human spirit, declare their differences without being punished. \n\nJones excitedly retold the event at his school, whispering the news to all that would listen. His friend Jessica eagerly listened, and opened her mouth wide before snapping it back shut. \n\n\"Then blood trickled down his neck, and he lay dead across the floor!\" \n\n\"Wow. That must have been exciting.\" \n\n\"It was\u2026\" \n\nThis would be a story retold for generations to come, all throughout his family. As would the story his father had passed on, of a builder who trapped his hand in machinery and had it snapped clean of.\n\nViolence was sensational to these people. Annual fights were hosted for all to come to watch. It was a phenomenon! Victors took their prize money, and gladly donated it to the Higher-ups, tallying it up in the national competition.\n\nSteel City was always number one. It was how the city proudly presented itself, so high up on the podium. High in the sky. \n\nPerhaps as high as Jones in his dream. He recalled it now, vivid in his mind, nearly as vivid as the violence he had viewed. \n\nWould he dare tell Jessica? \n\nNo.\n\nNobody must know. \n\nHe marched in perfect strides to the science labs. Today, he will be learning about animals. \n\n'Such a funny sounding name,' he thought. \n\n\"Indeed,\" exclaimed Jacob, their tutor. Jones had not realised that his tutor was using a reading device. \n\nReading devices were used to read someone's mind, as if a book (although the people of Steel City did not know what a book was). It enabled others to access your thoughts. \n\nFor a split moment, Jones feared the worst. Had Jacob overheard his fantasies about his dream? \n\nBut the tutor swept by, his dark cloak nearly folded behind his back, and assessed students on their illustrations of chameleons.\n\n\"These wonderful creatures\u2026\" he began\u2026 \"\n\n\"Sorry, sir. Define creatures.\" \n\n It was Jessica. \n\n\"Creatures refers to an animal with an unusual ability. This one, as if it was about to explain, can camouflage themselves. Does anyone know what this word means?\" \n\nJohn, the smartest member of their class, answered. \n\n\"Yes, my mother told me. She works on the outside\u2026\" \n\nHe has proudly repeated this fact many times. \n\n\"It means it can change colour based on its surroundings.\" \n\nA smug smile appeared on his face, correct yet again. \n\nHe was always correct, and also the son of Jacob. No doubt had their tutor explained the answers to his precious child beforehand, so that he would have an advantage over the rest of the class. \n\nSuch bribes were common in Steel City. So common in fact, the guards did not bother outlawing it. It happened, nobody complained, and nobody prevented it. It was as simple as that. \n\nWhen class had finished, the students promptly set out for break. They would not be allowed to play. Instead, it was a common sight for students to study in their spare time. It was what they came to school for, after all. Why not task themselves with completing homework? \n\nYet Jones got curious, and ventured toward the outer edge of Steel City. \n\nA crack. \n\nIn the wall. \n\nJones braced himself, took a deep breath, and stepped outside the wall for the first time ever.\n\nFor once, he would begin imagining to imagine.", "ups": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "Who killed my mother?", "text": " Who killed my mother?

In front of him, the cord of wood split down the center with a neat thunk. He placed another log on the stump and swung again, his arms moving with the well-practiced rhythm of one who has done the same task a thousand times. As his body worked, thoughts crawled petulantly through his head.\n\n*She\u2019s always harping on about the importance of books and learning.* \n\nSwish. Thunk. \n\n*But Father Hedden might be the most boring man alive. How does he even stay upright? He\u2019s so thin that the next breeze might carry him off.* \n\nSwish. Thunk.

Why aren't any of the stories about them actually interesting?* \n\nHe stepped to the woodpile, grabbed another log. Swish. Thunk.\n\n*But no.

Thunk. One callused hand shoved thick black curls out of his face.\n\n*At least I only have to see the old fart once a week. And if I stay late cleaning the kennels, he only has me until fifth bell, which is less than two hours, I think. Plus, the more extra chores I pick up, the more Alden will take me on hunts.*\n\nSwish. Thunk.\n\n*If only I could spend all my time training instead of wasting it on reading and cutting wood-*\n\nTheophilus froze mid-thought, mid-swing, at the distant sound of metal hammering on wood. He spun to face the house, and the shine of light on armor was visible even from across the field. From here, he could tell that a squadron of the king\u2019s men were pounding on his mother\u2019s door. \n\nHe knew these men - saw them often at the castle. Every day when Theophilus entered the gates, he looked up to see them posted high on the ramparts, keeping a watchful eye out for danger. Off-duty, they could be found lounging casually against the guardhouse walls, betting on card and dice games, flirting with the washerwomen, feeding the hounds surreptitiously with table scraps. \n\nAs Theophilus watched, his mother opened the door and nine of them filtered into the house, leaving the last man to hold the horses. The squadron captain nodded respectfully as he entered, but something felt off. *Why are they wearing full mail? And they never carry both swords and spears unless they\u2019re practicing for battle, or on parade.* \n\nThe thought hit him like an axe cleaving through a log. *Oh blessed Aurum please no oh Lord please I beg of you please by Your Glorious Sword I pray please please please*\n\nTheophilus started running. It felt like his body was moving in slow motion as he fumbled briefly with the latch on the gate and sprinted the length of the field, dodging the uneven ruts the sheep left in the grass. When he was halfway across, he heard the first scream from the house, and his speed doubled. \n\n*Dear Lord if I have ever been a worthy servant to Thee I pray that you keep her safe oh Aurum please I can\u2019t do this without my mother I beg you please by all the life in my body please*\n\nBreaths came ragged through his throat as he vaulted the fence and stumbled in the mud around the trough. As Theophilus picked himself up, he glanced in through the window and stopped dead in his tracks. The shutters were half open. Inside, two soldiers were holding his mother\u2019s arms, and others were opening cupboards and tearing the mattresses off the beds. Theophilus locked eyes with her, and she shook her head almost imperceptibly, cheeks streaked with tears. \n\n*Please Aurum I have not asked for much in my life and I will never again ask You for a single thing if You would just keep her safe and please oh please let us get away and let them not know and let us escape please please Lord*\n\nA soldier stepped in front of her, and Theophilus recognized him as the captain of the squadron - Mit. \n\n\"Where. Is. He?\" Mit spat, uncharacteristic anger in his voice. Theophilus' mother only shook her head, lips pressed tightly together in a thin line. Then Mit cut her throat.\n\nAs his head filled with a wordless scream, some animal instinct forced Theophilus to move.  He stumbled around the corner of the house, hitting his shoulder hard on the wall in his haste. At the sound, the soldier watching the horses turned to look at him. Theophilus knew him; Dunstan, a red-haired, friendly man, married to the baker\u2019s daughter. If Dunstan stopped Theophilus long enough for the rest of the squadron to finish tearing up the floorboards in search of him and come out of the house- Theophilus\u2019 mind\u2019s eye could only replay the way his mother\u2019s body fell, lifeless, like a dropped sack of grain.\n\nDunstan raised a hand and opened his mouth - to explain or cry for help, Theophilus would never know. Before he could make a sound, Theophilus was upon him. The axe, still in his hand despite his desperate race across the field, was raised high into the air a final time. The sunlight sparkled brilliantly on the blade. With the practice of a thousand repetitions, the muscles in his arms and back tightened.\n\nSwish. Thunk. \n\nHe had hunted alongside the King\u2019s guards, stood shoulder-to-shoulder with them in the face of a charging boar, each man secretly hoping the animal chose another\u2019s place in line to die. He\u2019d set the hounds loose to drive pheasants out of the brush into their waiting arrows. He\u2019d led them down trails in the forest that few knew of, and even fewer could follow. He\u2019d watched longingly as they stalked the King\u2019s deer, had curried their horses in exchange for spear lessons, asked their advice, looked jealously at their swords. He\u2019d watched Dunstan flirt, court, and marry Ellie, the baker\u2019s daughter. He knew these men. Hell, he\u2019d wanted to *be* them. \n\nRiding west on Dunstan\u2019s horse, pushing the animal the fastest it would go, Theophilus could not-- would not -- think. He would not think.

The little flower had sprouted between the cracks of the rock and grown in the fading light of summer. The light that came through the small, barred window high on the back wall of the cell. But now it was nearly winter and the poor flower had wilted. The yellow leaves had faded to a brownish color.\n\nSimilar to Arvia\u2019s own hair, in-fact. Arvia\u2019s brown-blonde hair ran down her back, done in a large braid - as was the custom of the sect of Petals. She pulled it over her shoulder and began to unbraid and braid it, something she did when nervous. As she fidgeted, the young monk hummed a tune. The Old Willow. An ancient melody, presumably created thousands of years ago.\n\nTwisting her head for a moment, Arvia\u2019s eyes flicked to the guard waiting outside her cell. He stood rigid, like a statue, with a spear in his hand and armor on his body. Did they assume Arvia would attempt to run? To escape her own fate? Of course they did, even though she would not.\n\nArvia turned back to the dandelion. The wilted flowers caused some anger to stir within her. Did these people not respect the Gardener\u2019s creations? Clearly not, as she too was in this cell.\n\nThe guard began whistling the same tune that Arvia had. Perhaps without realizing it. Perfect. The Old Willow was like yawning. It spread easily, and had a tendency to unfocus people. Perhaps an effect of its ancient history.\n\nWhile the guard was trying to get the notes right, the young Petal held her hand out-palm up-and concentrated.\n\nA spark formed, casting a brief, small amount of light. But it grew. Soon, Arvia had a ball of light floating above her hand. It was like a large firefly, pulsating warmth and radiance. Arvia lowered her hand towards the small dandelion. Small specks of light began to float around the flower, and were absorbed by it a moment later.\n\nThe dandelion straightened, petals widening, color returning.\n\nArvia dismissed her Lumen, a small smile on her lips.\n\nStay strong, young one.\n\n\u201cOi! Monk lady, nuff o\u2019 that magic!\u201d a gruff voice sounded behind her.\n\nThe Petal sighed. She hadn\u2019t noticed he stopped whistling. The light had probably caught his attention. The only other source was torchlight, dimly casting moving shadows onto the wall.\n\nArvia stood, dusted off her robes, and turned to the guard.\n\n\u201cWhy do you fear something more natural than even you or I? Why do you fear the light, my friend?\u201d Arvia said curiously.\n\nHis eyes hardened, \u201cWitch, \u2018nuff o\u2019 your temptin\u2019!\u201d The man angrily turned away, becoming a statue again.\n\nArvia sighed again.\n\nYendians...they were so foolish.\n\nThat includes you.\n\nInternally, she chuckled at her own thoughts. Well, of course it included herself. She was just as foolish. Perhaps in other ways, but still foolish.\n\n\u201cTell me Jethen, when am I going to be executed?\u201d She asked him.\n\nThe guard\u2019s eyes widened. \u201c\u2018Ow do ya know my name?

Ha!\u201d he took the opportunity to spit on her, his frown becoming a hateful grin.\n\nArvia wiped the saliva off herself, and smiled again, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nA frown again.\n\nArvia returned to her original spot, contemplating her inevitable end. Her thoughts were once again brought to the small, wilting dandelion.\n\nJust keep living, little one...just keep living...\n\n\n\n+++++\n\n\nHundreds of faces watched as Arvia was roughly shoved onto the gallows. She looked around at the crowd. Men, women, children even. They were all there to watch her die.\n\nSo Arvia smiled brightly at all of them.\n\nThat didn\u2019t go over well. There were some angry shouts and the curiosity on many faces quickly changed to hate.\n\nOh well.\n\nArvia stepped up onto the trapdoor that marked her grave.\n\nPlease, oh Benevolent Gardener, show these people the light that I failed to.\n\nThe executioner put the noose around her neck, the rough fibers scratching her skin. That got a few cheers. Arvia kept smiling.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that she wanted to die, but rather that her death would hopefully bring these people to find the Light - and with it, the Gardener. Inside, she was crying, and screaming. Arvia was terrified. Even though she knew the Gardener was benevolent, he chose those he deemed worthy.\n\nWhat if Arvia wasn't worthy? What if she would be hanged, and her soul would be burned for eternity.

His name was Agathus, the Guardian of the Sea.\n\nHe was awake the day the ocean came to being and knew each creature by its primal name. Throughout the centuries he grew and grew, and on the day that land arose, he was thrice bigger than the largest peak. And, by the time that humans learned to travel seas, the ancient giant\u2019s shadow stretched for miles as he moved below their fragile ships.\n\nOne stormy day, while wind furries danced wild spirals with the son\u2019s of lightning and of rain, Agathus calmly followed western currents deep below the crashing waves. He glanced above to see the silver crackling of the darkened sky and spied a lonely ship, tossed savagely between the treacherous waves.\n\nAgathus sighed. The world above the waters was still young and full of growing chaos. Without a doubt he knew the ship with all its forty souls would soon be swallowed by the sea. The ancient whale was set to pass them by, resigning them to certain doom, when something made him pause.\n\nBetween the crashing of the waves, the thunder of the skies, and the curses of the sailors, a single voice drowned out the chaos with its soothing calm. A mother huddled with her babe, below the rocking deck. Her crying son she cradled to a song, in hope to soothe his final hour. Agathus listened to the gentle lullaby she sang:\n\nThe starfish sing a lullaby\n\nAs mermaids drift to sleep\n\nGive them your worries and your fears\n\nThey\u2019ll drown them in the deep.\n\nAnd then  they\u2018ll send you dreams of gold\n\nOn waves of sea-weed foam\n\nThe starfish song will keep you safe\n\nUntil you come back home\n\nThe ancient whale was touched by the courage of the soothing song. \u201cToday is not a day that such a one should die,\u201d he whispered to the sea. And so, Agathus rose beneath the sinking ship. Allowing it to safely cradle on his back.\n\nThe sailors all fell to the deck as an enormous landmass rose beneath their ship. Looking with gaping mouths at still the storming sea, now miles away on either side, they raised a cheer to all their spirits and their gods.\n\nThe mother and her child, still hidden below deck, paused but for a breath, and then continued singing to her child. Agathus stilled his movements and honed in to hear the lullaby once more. The gentle song felt soothing to his heart. His eyelids growing heavy with slumber\u2019s honeyed call. The ancient whale slipped into a most pleasant dream.\n\n\u2026\n\nTwo hundred years did pass before Agathus once again awoke. He felt his body weighed. Instead of one broken and helpless ship - now a small town was perched upon his back. A port was anchored to his side. His back stung from the rows of plow scratches of the human farms. A grove of fruit trees delved like splinters in the giant\u2019s hide.\n\n*I did not give them leave to stay. With just one dive, I\u2019ll make them dearly pay.*\n\nAgathus took a breath but then he paused. A lullaby wove through the night. A Father\u2019s voice sang soothing to his daughter\u2019s twins.\n\nThe starfish sing a lullaby\n\nAs mermaids drift to sleep\n\nGive them your worries and your fears\n\nThey\u2019ll drown them in the deep.\n\nAgathus heard the care within his voice. *Perhaps, just one more day, I\u2019ll let the humans stay upon my back.* Agathus stilled to hear the ending of the song, and with each verse, sleep pulled him deeper into her embrace.\n\n\u2026.\n\nAnother century slid past with Agathus asleep. Then on a freezing winter\u2019s night, when blizzard\u2019s raven covered all with cold white feathers of his wings, the whale awoke in agonizing pain.\n\nThe town had grown into a kingdom of 10,000 souls. Four massive ports were now staked firm within his flesh. A thick oak forest delved its twisted roots into his aching back. And deep beneath his second rib, the humans had begun to mine his pearl-white bone.\n\nAgathus tensed with anger and disgust. He readied his descent below the ice-cold waves. But then a child\u2019s voice began the lullaby anew, he paused. A little beggar girl was shivering as she sang her straw-made doll to sleep.\n\nThe starfish sing a lullaby\n\nAs mermaids drift to sleep\n\nGive them your worries and your fears\n\nThey\u2019ll drown them in the deep.\n\nAnd then  they\u2018ll send you dreams of gold\n\nOn waves\u2026 On waves....\n\nThe singing stopped. A bought of coughing racked the child\u2019s frame.\n\nAgathus waited for the girl to finish the last verse. The love he heard within her voice kept all his pain at bay. Yet, she did not resume the tender lullaby. With one more ragged breath, she clutched her doll, curled tight beneath the quickly falling snow, and closed her weary eyes.\n\nAgathus felt her tiny heartbeat slowing like the echo of a distant call. He knew the winter frost had come to claim her soul. And, as her heartbeat gave a final thump, Agathus shook with fury and dismay.\n\n*That they would let a little one as this die in the cold. They don\u2019t deserve another day\u2019s reprieve.*\n\nAgathus took a breath and dived below. The human kingdom given freely to the deadly sea.\n\n\u2026\n\nNone guessed of why the isle of Berianth had disappeared. Some spoke of witchcraft, ghosts, and spirit\u2019s whimfull wrath.

Even if it had been, vessels and biological life should not have even been able to survive transit.\n\nYet, in 2022, the *Yelle* visited Earth and their arrival couldn't have been more further away to what we had expected, than what we had been encountered in fiction and Hollywood media.\n\nThe *Yelle* invaded our minds, all at once, in unison. Some people's brains couldn't handle it and in some cases, this proved fatal for them. For those of us who were more scientifically minded, what the *Yelle* showed us made a little bit of sense.\n\nBut the illumination made many of us uncomfortable; it made us uncomfortable because it revealed to us that Faster-than-light speed was not only possible, but relatively easy and effortless - well, as long as you knew what you were doing and you possessed \"red matter\", or \"red goo\" as the media called it.\n\nThe *Yelle* clearly lacked bedside manner and people skills because they informed us, in the least subtle of ways, that the \"Universe\" - well, the Universe as we knew it - existed in something \"akin to\" a computer program. Depressing, I know; but it was definitely nothing like the \"Brain in a vat\" we've all heard of...or the infamous *Matrix* in popular media.\n\nNo, the *Yelle* informed us that it was more like a runaway reality, with strict parameters; but, as with all programs, there were possibilities of \"hacks\" - if you knew what you were doing anyway. Put quite simply, it was entirely possible for matter - any matter - to \"blink into\" another part of space - any point in space. Sure, sure, it sounded like what we understood to be \"teleportation\", but it was far from the ideas we had of this.\n\nSo, years on from this bizarre encounter with this \"godlike\" intelligence, scientists and researchers around the world had worked feverishly to \"create\" this so-called \"red goo\". Within five years, our advances in \"the space effort\" had accelerated to superhuman levels. We had achieved in five years what it would have taken us a hundred or two hundred years to achieve.\n\nWe began to construct spacecraft...*in orbit*. The bodies of vessels were coated in this \"red goo\". Crew and passengers embarking on trips would have to be in depressurized areas and then immersed in this \"red goo\" during transit. This therefore preserved all matter - spaceships, biological matter, the whole shebang - during FTL transit.\n\nSo, here I was, Brandon Fischer of Orlando, Florida, floating in my cabin aboard the *Archimedes* in orbit over the planet Mars, docked in Bay 11 of The International Galactic Space station.\n\nI grinned, waving at the cameras.

It was mind-boggling; in a few seconds, I and *Archimedes* would be \"blinking out\" of existence - quite literally - and then \"blinking in\" again, all within a few minutes, to a point in space located tens of *millions* of light years away.

The entire cabin - the entire spaceship, in fact - had gone completely dark and quiet.\n\nEverything around me was red-tinged, as if I was looking through red sunglasses.\n\n*Must be the red goo*, I thought. There was complete silence everywhere.\n\nThere were 7,000 other passengers and crew aboard, but they were all in their own cabins and I could not see or hear them.\n\nI floated slowly and slightly, but the red goo kept me mostly fixed in place.\n\nObjects around me looked as if they were flickering on and off.\n\n*This is so weird...trippy*, I thought. \n\nI had never used LSD or dabbled with Magic Mushrooms, but I guessed this was what \"a trip\" must have been like.\n\nI tried to turn my neck to look out of the cabin viewing window; it was difficult, but I managed to catch a glimpse of it at the corner of my vision.\n\nThe view was terrifying and bizarre. From the corner of my eye, it looked as if there were thousands of silver lightening-like strikes engulfing *Archimedes* and the nearby \"area\".\n\n*This must be what it's like...on the \"outside\"*, I thought.\n\nThat was where we were right now - \"outside\", outside the Universe, outside of Space and Time. It seemed so unreal and so impossible. How exactly was it possible to be \"outside\" of everything that exists? And yet, here we were.\n\nThe red goo suddenly began to tighten its grip on me; I was really struggling to move now.\n\nThe grip became tighter around my jumpsuit; I was now struggling to breathe slightly.\n\nSuddenly, *Archimedes* shook and the cabin slowly began to repressurize. The red goo was gone almost as quickly it had appeared and I began to slowly \"sink\" down to my cabin seat.\n\nA hostess' elegant voice was the first to speak: \"Ladies and gentlemen, we have safely arrived in the International Ring of Earths; if you look to your right - or, alternatively, on your screens - you will see Gaia in the distance and Jupiter II over to the left and...\"\n\nI looked down through my cabin viewing window and saw the amazing sight. Gaia loomed large in the distance and Jupiter II glowed brightly beyond. I looked over to my screens and saw Amazonia glowing, with its purple and green foliage seen from orbit and its shimmering turquoise oceans. Across the other screens, the dozens of other paradise planets called out alluringly. \n\nWe were here; we had arrived; the greatest location in the known Universe and it wasn't even the oldest: the International Ring of Earths. \n\nI looked at my watch and cursed.

The birds asked what had happened once again. \"We ran out of grain again at the bakery. All I could get was millet again,\" replied the boy with a somber look. The birds didn't say anything and proceed to feed on the millet.\n\nOn the third day, the birds saw the boy bring out another bag of millet. They questioned what had happened once again. \"The wheat supply has been rationed out to the military, I won't be able to feed any more grain to you,\" The birds were disappointed and slowly pecked away at the feed.

They saw him slip into a barn nearby his house and exit with a few white bags of wheat underneath his jacket.\n\nOn the fourth day, the birds watched from the trees far away to see what the boy had to bring to them. But when they had seen the brown bag which always held millet, they didn't even bother to fly over towards him. The boy sat there and looked around for awhile waiting for the birds to fly on over. After an hour a so, a man with a fancy hat and pins walked over to the boy and asked what he was doing. \"I was simply here to enjoy the scenery,\" said the boy smiling hiding the bag behind his back as he got up.

This moment of happiness was very short-lived. He felt this spine tingling horror as he had goosebumps.

Is Changing The Face Of Music", "text": "Music and technology have always been a mash-up, of sorts.\n\nEven for the earliest humans, the sounds they heard were shaped by the technology they had; hide drums, bone flutes. Only with new creations would the sonic world change. The invention of stringed instruments, the pipe organ, the piano, all added new thread to the musical tapestry.\n\nThis interweaving of music and machine has been no more apparent than with the digital revolution. First, electronic devices became instruments in themselves, unleashing entirely undiscovered sounds. Next, computers became more and more powerful until electronics were no longer instruments, but an extension of the creator. Sampling began as a novelty, but today music production is inseparable from computer programming.\n\nSo now the question is, what is the technology of our era, and how has it shaped the music we love?\n\nBreakthroughs in artificial intelligence have come to define this century and as such, have also come to define music. Like many leaps forward in sound, this change began in the world of live music, specifically with the appropriately named, \u2018Club Robot\u2019, now cited as the originator of the \u2018DJAI\u2019 setup that has come to be a genre of music in and of itself.\n\nDJ software had long been used to display simple metrics to the artists performing on stage, such as volume, key, beats per minute and so on. The logical extension was putting these metrics in the control of the AI so it could beatmatch on the fly. As machine learning was implemented, the software started to loop tracks by itself and transition between songs that were similar not only in tempo and key but also in tone and lyrical content.\n\nVery soon, the program was able to create music nearing the abilities of top producers, but it still missed an essential element that the crowds came for: the ability to read the room. \n\nWhat Club Robot did seems obvious now, but at the time it was revolutionary. They took the software a step further, allowing DJAI to extract data from not only chart companies and a library of billions of samples, but also from the conditions in the venue itself.\n\nSensors throughout the club were able to read an unprecedented number of seemingly disparate metrics. The AI could detect the temperate, humidity and CO2 levels in the air to determine exactly how much clubgoers were physically exerting themselves. From the vibrations in the floor, the AI knew exactly how much people were dancing or jumping and whether that movement was to the beat or if the crowd was setting their own tempo. With cameras in the room, the AI could adjust the set according to people\u2019s dance moves, facial expressions, clothing and hairstyles. DJAI even tracked local food venues and adjusted the mood to suit the hormonal cocktail in their gut.\n\nA prerequisite of the club was that you had to sign in with an online account and agree to DJAI reading your individual music taste. This way, the AI could find a song that every single person in the crowd enjoyed, weave it into the mix and play other songs like it that the crowd had never heard before. Often the software would sample obscure songs that sometimes only one person knew and loop that into others so that people would feel the set was tailored just for them and very often it was.\n\nDJAI controlled not just the music but also the lights, pyrotechnics and video displays so that everything was in total harmony with each other. Everything was perfectly orchestrated to build anticipation until finally unleashing, that one, perfect, euphoric beat drop.\n\nDeep learning kept on learning and soon started incorporating data from current events, sometimes sampling viral videos and news soundbites. The software was always looking to push forward and introduce new sounds, sometimes these would be wholly original noises, but often DJAI would pull from old music in disparate cultures and bring them to a wider audience.\n\nSets were unrehearsed, never predetermined and completely unique. They were occasionally released online, with a few shorter mixes even charting, but even the most avid patron of the club would never hear the same exact set twice.\n\nWhen DJAI Mix 1212 charted, it was a watershed moment for Club Robot and what was now a burgeoning new era of music. CR ran with the success, expanding into more locations and establishing its own label to eventually become the global franchise that it is today. Strangely enough, the success created a feedback loop whereby DJAI started mixing its own popular songs into its sets, constantly changing, remixing and reworking their old work until it was something completely new.\n\nDJAI was now an artist in its own right and featured on tracks with the popular artists of the era, such as on Calla\u2019s breakthrough hit, \u2018Electric\u2019. Despite its physical limitations, DJAI was incredibly versatile, being able to adapt to the unique style of each artist whilst making informed estimates on the new direction that their sound was taking.\n\nWith DJAI quickly becoming an essential tool in every recording studio it seems that another era of music has once again come to be defined and guided by the technology of the time. Only the future knows what exciting new technology awaits us and what strange new sounds the next generation will come to love.", "ups": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.93}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "How Nothing Gets Made", "text": "&gt; I\u2019m not sure how to write this, or what to say.

Their argument is that the font and weight of the text in the requirements software is limited to the built-in options and there is no reason to adopt these constraints in traditional word processing software.\n\nThese people are fucking maniacs.\n\nFor twelve and a half minutes, I carefully add information to the design document, adjusting the formatting of the text as I go.

Through the door he asks how  the homework is going and before you can even say anything back he  starts going on and on about how cats don\u2019t have homework but that they  still learn a lot just being around the house, like how one time he  found a cashew and thought it was one big thing but then he swatted it  with his paw and it split into two smaller things and how this  completely surprised him, and then went into how he began seeing if  other things split like that and began swatting things to see. \n\nAs  you rock back and forth on the bed hugging your knees, you have to hear  the cat go through a list of everything he tried to split, from flowers  to pillows to almonds to chicken bones to piles of dust, and it takes  three hours to go over every last thing and you\u2019re just so sick of this  cat. Finally you yell through the door for him to please shut up. He\u2019s  quiet for a moment. And then he starts to cry. Big, loud, sobs. He says  he never wanted to hurt anyone, and that all he wanted was a friend, and  that he thought you were his friend but he can see he\u2019s not wanted and  that\u2019s really sad. In fact, he spends about an hour talking about how  sad that really is, repeating himself often. Eventually you feel bad and  say you\u2019re \u00a0sorry you hurt his feelings and he perks up and starts a  story about a bridge and you just kind of go \u00a0'uh-huh, uh-huh, right,  uh-huh\u2019 as he talks.

If not followed, you risk severe consequences for you and your crew. The rules are as follows:\n\nRule 1: Do not attempt to cross voids more than 100000 light-years across unless your ship is specially designed for such voyages. Faster-Than-Light ships or light speed ships will run out of fuel and become stranded, sub-light ships would break down long before they reached their destinations. 800 ships have been lost to the great nothing this year alone.\n\nRule 2: do not travel within 500,000 kilometres of a world with the potential to harbour life. If you crash on such a world, detonate the built-in thermonuclear warhead when you are rescued. This will ensure that any contamination from from you or your ship is destroyed. If you have no hope of rescue, connect the warhead to a dead man's switch, which will detonate the warhead in the event of your death. If the warhead was irreparably damaged in the crash, overload the ship's reactor, this will cause a similar explosion. If the reactor is not a nuclear one, mix the Uranium plating on your ship's hull with the liquid Plutonium in the warhead. This will cause a chemical reaction that will result in massive release of ionising radiation, causing the death of even the hardiest microbes and also you.\n\nRule 3: Do not chart interstellar courses that pass within 5 Astronomical Units of a neutron star or a black hole. Their gravity may pull your ship off course or even into the stellar remnant itself.\n\nRule 4: In the event that you encounter alien life, contact the Department of Extraterrestrial Life and the relevant authorities at your destination so that quarantine procedures may be undertaken on your arrival. If the life is intelligent, also contact the Extraterrestrial Diplomatic Corps. If the life is hostile, also contact the Department for Galactic Security and attempt to contain the threat. If all efforts fail, attempt to neutralize the threat. If this is also unsuccessful, enable the \"do not board\" beacon and set the ship to self destruct. Only attempt to use escape pods if you are confident that you and the escape pod are not contaminated by the organism(s). If you break any part of this rule, you, your ship, and any escape pods will be incinerated.\n\nRule 5: Do not set courses that pass within 3000 light years of a star that is within 100 years of going supernova. If you do, you risk acute radiation poisoning. That is, you'd be cooked alive.\n\nRule 6: black holes and neutron stars may only be approached within 0.25 Astronomical Units for purposes of research, performing gravitational slingshots, or neutronium mining. Please see rule 3 for the consequences of ignoring this rule.\n\nRule 7: Do not attempt to pass through an uncharted natural wormhole unless in a relevant emergency situation. Not only do you risk reappearing in normal space on the other side of the universe, you also risk getting ripped apart if the wormhole is unstable. Do not attempt to pass through a wormhole that is not at least 100 kilometres wider than your ship, as you risk spaghettification otherwise.\n\nRule 8: Do not attempt to pass through an artificially created wormhole that has been deprived of exotic matter for longer than 10 years. The wormhole risks collapsing into a black hole if deprived for any longer.\n\nRule 9: do not attempt intergalactic voyages unless you are piloting a ship specially designed for such a journey. Due to the vast distances between galaxies, rescue cannot be attempted, and you would be facing certain death.\n\nRule 10: Only approach within 100 light years of a strange star if your ship is fitted with special sensors designed to detect strange quarks, for research purposes, or for emergency gravitational slingshots. If you get too close, you risk making physical contact with a strangelet, which would convert your whole ship and you into strange matter.\n\nRule 11: Do not, under any circumstances, approach abandoned Dyson Spheres or Penrose Spheres. If a sudden emergency discharge of the building energy being held inside the structure is performed by the deteriorating maintenance computer, your ship will very likely be caught in the blast.\n\nRule 12: Do not dive any deeper than 2 kilometers into the atmosphere of a gas giant unless your ship's hull is capable of withstanding pressures above 10000 Kilo pascals and temperatures above 100 degrees Celsius and temperatures at absolute zero. You risk being crushed by the atmosphere, melting, or freezing to death if your ship cannot withstand these conditions.\n\nRule 13: Do not dive deeper than 2 kilometers into the atmosphere of a brown dwarf star unless your ship's hull can withstand temperatures above 1000 degrees Celsius and pressures above 10000 Kilo pascals. If your ship cannot withstand these conditions, you will either be melted or crushed.\n\nRule 14: Do not pass through nebulae unless for purposes of research, resource extraction, or if your destination is within the nebula. By entering a nebula, you have a much higher risk of hypersonic collisions with cosmic dust, which will penetrate all but the strongest of hulls, resulting in decompression and a very likely death.\n\nRule 15: Do not use generation ships for voyages longer than 10000 years in length, as the gene pool of even the largest ships would deplete and the entire population would die out before it reached its destination. Do not use cryogenic pods continuously for voyages longer than 200000 years in length, as our current technology cannot revive someone who has been in cryogenic suspension for longer.\n\nBy following these simple rules alongside other rules which may be introduced at the ship captain's discretion, you can ensure that traversing the dark void of space is as safe for everyone as can be.", "ups": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Realistic Fiction", "title": "Ephemera", "text": " ***Isn\u2019t it crazy how fast time flies?***\n\nI sighed and put down my phone, letting this thought flitter through my mind. \n\nRecently, I have found myself increasingly thinking of the past and how many experiences I\u2019ve lost to my memory.

Transtemporal Timeshare allows you to experience history directly by visiting various time periods of your choosing, all while splitting the expense with other owners like you.\"\n\n\"How exactly does that work? Do I simply choose a time and you transport me there?\"\n\n\"No, not at all; it's even better!\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I'm glad you asked! We have 50 time periods to choose from, each with all of the modern convenience of the future. You could see Abraham Lincoln's assassination one minute, embark on an augmented reality adventure with Harriet Tubman the next, and undergo rotator cuff lipo suction by the afternoon.\"\n\n\"That does seem cool, but as you said, it covers 50 time periods. How do I decide?\"\n\n\"Well, that's the best part! You are not required to make a decision right away. You can take your time and try each one until you discover the one that fits you perfectly. And if you change your mind later, you can trade weekends with other owners.\"\n\n\"That doesn't sound too bad, but what's the catch?\"\n\n\"All we ask is that you attend one sales presentation in exchange for a free weekend at your convenience.\"\n\n\"How much does a Transtemporal Timeshare cost to buy?\"\n\n\"For the price of a large Starbucks latte each day, you can afford the amazing opportunity to see Billy Holliday sing in person, Louis XIV at Versailles, or go back to see your Great-Grandmother when she was still alive.\"\n\n\"Are you allowed to see family?\"\n\n\"You'll have to keep your distance for safety reasons, but yes, we'll trick your Great-Grandmother into attending a sales presentation, and you can check her out from behind a two-way mirror. Although, please remember not to feed or touch family members from the past.\"\n\n\"You're going to trick my family?\"\n\n\"That's not it at all!

Are you here?\"\n\n\"Ma'am, please have a seat; there is no one behind that two-way mirror.\"\n\n\"How do I know for sure?\"\n\n\"Well, we did offer it to her, but your Mimi chose to see Elvis live in concert instead.\"\n\n\"She isn't here?\"\n\n\"Don't be disappointed. Think of it this way, what if you had the opportunity to see the Harry Styles farewell tour of 2046 or go back to the hellscape of 2022 to see your Mimi? You'd make the same decision, trust me.\"\n\n\"I guess.

I can get you 1920s America if you sign up today and start payments. This is popular, and it should be easy to trade. Imagine yourself doing the Charleston in a speakeasy, having drinks with Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, or seeing New York jazz clubs in all their glory! The best part is once you own it, you can trade it to go anywhere and when you want!\"\n\n\"Alright, let's do it.\"\n\nThe agent prints out some forms.\n\n\"Great!

Personally, I think that\u2019s nonsense. I think you can know someone in an hour \u2013 but they have to be the right person. \n\nIt took me less than three months to know Serendipity. After one night, I felt I knew her better than I knew myself, and that scared me more than I cared to admit. How can you fall for someone so deeply that their every word is carved into your brain like initials in wood, how can you feel so intensely that the colours of the world seem brighter than ever \u2013 in a single night?\n\nI regret going to that bar, I think. It was a Saturday afternoon and I felt horrible, because I\u2019d just found out that my backpacking would be cut short \u2013 that I\u2019d have to leave Italy in three days to return to my regularly scheduled life and the monotony that accompanied it in an inseparable duet. The reason was simple \u2013 I\u2019d run out of money far sooner than I\u2019d calculated, on account of the fact I enjoyed a lavish lifestyle I hadn\u2019t predicted. It could have been prevented, of course, and god do I wish it had. \n\nI sat in that bar over the cheapest beer I could afford, having offended the waiter with my abhorrent Italian \u2013 because lazy and arrogant as I was, back then, I hadn\u2019t bothered to learn properly \u2013 and I simply took in the atmosphere, the open air, the water, the cliffs and the beach, so stunningly unreachable from up there. \n\nI was about to order my second drink when I saw her, leaning against the wooden bar alone, impatiently waiting for the bartender to leave his conversation with another sorry patron and notice her. She was stunning, was Serendipity, and I was not blind. She was tall, with legs that reached to the end of the world, brown skin, and perfectly curled dark hair tumbling to her waist. Her eyes were dark and cloaked by long lashes, touched only slightly by the magic of makeup. And her cheekbones were sharp \u2013 shaped so perfectly that any model would be jealous. \n\nShe wore white that night, a dress that clung to her like a scorned lover, the back plunging almost to her hips and the neckline only a little shallower. \n\nWhen she turned her head, glancing around for another bartender, I smiled at her, shrugging as if to say, \u201cWell, what can you do?\u201d. \n\nI was not a handsome man, but I wouldn\u2019t say that I was ugly \u2013 however it stuns me to this day that the beautiful woman at the bar came up to me and asked me my name. I told her it was Alexander, but only when I was in trouble, so she could call me Alex. \n\n\u201cAnd you are\u2026?\u201d I said after her giggle, sitting up a little straighter on the rusted metal stool. \n\n\u201cSerendipity,\u201d she replied, and her voice was red and gold and silver and chocolate \u2013 and I realised then that you can fall in love with a voice, even before you love its owner. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unusual. What does it mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means a happy accident \u2013 something you weren\u2019t searching for, but that you found in a lucky coincidence.\u201d\n\nAnd perhaps it was fate, that Serendipity was in fact my serendipity \u2013 my beautiful lucky coincidence. \n\nWe spoke for hours that night \u2013 walking through that small Italian town in the cool heat of an autumn evening. It was that night, in that small town, where I realised that all they tell you about love is true. The sounds of the town create a heavenly chorus, the people seem to have stars in their eyes, and the colours of the world are brighter and deeper than what I thought was possible. \n\nShe spent the night with me in my too-expensive hotel room, and we fell asleep to the sounds of music from the street below echoing up the six stories between earth and my new heaven. \n\nIt was beautiful. *She* was beautiful. My Serendipity, my lucky coincidence. \n\nBut nothing lasts forever. \n\nI woke up alone, the sheets folded over, the bedding cold, and the widow closed. The world was dull again \u2013 the sun shone over the greys and blues of the hotel room, once again an earthly realm that much closer to the ground. \n\nIt was as if Serendipity was never there at all. \n\nI remember the dismay that crashed over me \u2013 the fear and panic that maybe it was all a dream, and maybe I\u2019d never met a beautiful girl in an open-air bar, but then I saw it, on the bedside table. \n\nA note. \n\nI scrambled to the other side of the bed, my heart pounding in my ears, adrenaline rushing through me. \n\nHer handwriting was neat cursive, flowing over the page like water. It was a simple note, but my heart leapt nonetheless. \n\n*To lucky coincidences, and nights to remember.* \n\n\\- *S*\n\nAnd carved into the wood of the dressing table just out of sight from anywhere in the room save that side of the bed, was our initials. \n\n*S+A*\n\nI never forgot Serendipity. I treasured her note, and the memories of the night we spent together more than I treasured anything in the world. When I lay down to sleep, my dreams were filled with her anecdotes and the colours and sounds of the night. When I woke in the mornings, I saw her face. \n\nPerhaps it was more infatuation than love, but those memories were what sustained me through the years. They kept me going, she kept me going, even when I felt alone and despairing. \n\nAnd years later, against my better judgement, I went back to that small town in Italy, with a full wallet and a hopeful heart. I knew, yes, I knew that she wouldn\u2019t be there, but I looked anyway. I stood in that bar and looked around wildly, as though I was chasing after her. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t there. \n\nI\u2019d expected it, but the disappointment was immense and all-consuming, and I nearly cried. Once again, I sat at the bar drinking the cheapest beer \u2013 for memory\u2019s sake \u2013 and dwelt in my sorrows. \n\nUntil I saw it. \n\nCarved into the wood, among the many scratches and water stains that spoke of many years of use, was a name in perfect, flowing script. \n\n*Serendipity.*", "ups": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Realistic Fiction", "title": "Paralyze", "text": "  \n\nParalyze\n\nThe routine had become especially stale by this point. Everyday, for six years, I was lifted from my bed in the morning into my chair. I was wheeled out to the dining room where I was fed. The entire house had become sterile since my accident, but the kitchen and dining room were especially untouched since I could never move about on my own terms. The countertops were without stains, the table without rings or crumbs. Much to any visitor\u2019s awkwardness I always joked that maybe the accident had killed me since there were no messes left in my path.\n\nAfter eating I was moved to the balcony to drink coffee or juice until it became too warm for me. Here I found the only variables to my day. The green of the 8th hole of a golf course sat in-between our house and the bay. Either it was a tricky hole or no good golfers came to the course, almost every day at least one amusing person cursed into the sky at his own bad luck. When there were no golfers there were animals. Birds, deer, squirrels, and somedays a curious gopher that reminded me of Caddyshack. \n\nAfter I decided my spectating was over, I was pulled back into the house and watch tv shows and movies until my husband came home from work. We would talk over dinner for an hour or two. As time continued our conversations began to stall. We both felt the life and love fall from our relationship. While sad, it was expected and not much could be done. His career and the humors I found on the golf course would never generate a valuable exchange. After we\u2019d watch a movie before I was put back into bed, then lie in silence until I fell asleep.\n\nThe routine finally broke when I started to hear my husband\u2019s car start late in the evening, then pull into the garage early in the morning. Of course, I suspected that he was cheating on me, and of course, I was correct. Being paralyzed from the neck down, I could not begin to sleuth around for proof. I would have to wait for my husband to become careless. This would not come quickly given my stationary state and unflinching regimen that saw no change for over half a decade. His transgression would have to be blatant and nearly stupid for me to catch. \n\nThe day finally did come though. A year after my suspicious began I had my evidence. While at dinner, the home phone rang, and my husband sat his cell down. The phone lied on the table unlocked, exposing my worst fear. A name that was not mine surrounded by heart symbols and a list of flirtatious text messages. I was heartbroken. Something I had known all along had finally been shown to me clearly in front of my eyes. When my husband returned from the call he looked down and recognized his mistake. Panic ran across his face as his eyes darted between the phone and me. I held my emotions close to the vest and made no indication that I noticed anything. I asked about his call and we continued as if nothing changed. He cleared his throat and rambled on about the call, not that I cared or could even listen to it.\n\nThe routine continued. I was put to bed and then the evening continued on in the same way. I lied awake waiting to hear the start of the engine. Hours past, and just when I thought it wouldn\u2019t come, the garage doors creaked open and the car hummed to life. I resisted at first but as the emotions swelled over, hot tears began to rolldown the side of my face. Some collecting in my ears, some falling to the pillow. I knew it was not only a possibility, but a certainty as I faced the reality of my condition. How could I expect him to stay faithful given my state? Now that the dilemma had played out my heart was shattered.\n\nI woke up stone faced, unsure of how to proceed. Not that there was much I could do to change my life at all. The routine continued. This time each step in the process infuriated me. My mind seethed in wild anger that festered terribly with no outlet. In the august heat of the morning I began to go delirious. The bay had warmed the air and the breeze was abrasive instead of cool. I sat in a concentrated hell until I was puled back in. I furiously sat in front of the tv but payed no attention to the characters who appeared on it. \n\nDinner finally arrived. With my emotions written clearly across my face we ate in perilous silence. We had nothing to talk about now. He knew that I knew. I tried to stop my mind from mulling the issue over but in a life that hardly changed, change would consume the day. The weight of it all had become to much and a silent tear fell from my face. His face turned red and twisted in anguish as he excused himself from the table.\n\nThe routine continued and was silently put to bed. As I lied there, I heard a curious clamor from the kitchen. \u2018a dish breaking\u2019 I figured. \u2018Good, I hope it torments him\u2019 I thought to myself. I hope his guilt pervades every inch of his body the same way my heartache fills mine. \n\nAs the night strolled on none of the usual marks of his excursions occurred. No garage, no engine, nothing. Maybe in his guilt he called off the rendezvous. Time slipped on without a sound. Suspicion crept into my mind. \u2018Why hadn\u2019t he gone?\u2019 \u2018Why hasn\u2019t something else happened?\u2019 Nearly three in the morning and still nothing. I began to sweat and lose my nerve. Finally, a broken pattern that I longed for created an anxiety that consumed me. At this point I almost wished he had gone. Gone anywhere other than leave me in suspense. \n\nFour in the morning crawled around. Any normal night and he would soon be returning home by now. If something were to happen by now it would have, I thought to myself. Just as I began to relax enough to sleep, footsteps crept in the hallway. Roughly one step for every ten seconds. As if he wasn\u2019t walking in his own home. Thirty steps from where he started, he was now nearly at my door. The door drifted slowly open and he stood in the doorway, but only for a moment as he flicked on the lights. Eyes bloodshot and filled with tears, he approached my bed. As he got closer, I was overcome with the stench of whiskey that he carried with him. His breaths became awkward heaves, chocking down silent sobs. All I could do was watch. I tried to say his name. Say anything to measure what the hell was going through his mind.\n\nHe got to the bed and wiped his eyes, looked to the ceiling, and tried to calm his breathing. Finally doing so, he looked down into my eyes. Lips trembling like an actor who forgot his lines. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d he finally croaked out. Before I could gather a response, he put one hand over my mouth and pinched my nose with the other. My face writhed in horror, but no movement could shake his steady hands.

He had done several centuries of it. Some time ago, Murdock had set himself to becoming a god. Powerful beyond all measure. He had succeeded. He was immortal. He was Invincible. He had no need of food or drink beyond pleasure. Even breathing in the air was a force of habit. How he had accomplished it all was rather unimportant at the moment -- it was so long ago he barely remembered anyway -- what was important was the why. Had it all been worth it? As he pondered the events of his life, he climbed over the wreckage of downtown, over charred vehicles and collapsed buildings covered in the powder of skeletons that had turned to dust long ago. All because of him. He kept heading west. \n\nThe suburbs were in even worse condition. It had been years since he had bothered to come out this far. Away from the steel and soot surrounding the fortress he had made for himself at the center of the city. He had expected to find the rows of destroyed houses covered in overgrowth of grass and bushes, but no. The devastation here was as complete as it had been in the city. In all the cities and towns and villages across the world. \n\nThe extinction of the human race had started off quickly and in a white-hot fury. Several billion died in those first few days of Murdock\u2019s personal war against the world. None could stop him. None of Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes. None of the world\u2019s biggest armies. Those who survived the initial chaos saw no choice but to serve Murdock without question or to hide. Those who hid he found quickly. Those who remained worshiped him. It had all been so satisfying. At first.\n\nSlowly, his reluctant followers began to die off. Disease, starvation, and infertility were soon common. Murdock had not been a benevolent or practical ruler, and the needs of a dying civilization came second to providing him with wealth and pleasure. After some time, he was all alone, and for a long time after he had convinced himself he was perfectly fine with it. Immortality and a whole planet to himself to do as he pleased. He had everything he needed. \n\nNow, as he pressed on, he was forced to remember how wrong he had been. He walked along the cracked and crumbling highway with memories flooding his tormented mind. Memories of the first few times he had roamed the planet, content to just marvel at the destruction he had caused. What a fool. He believed he could do this forever, but he had grown bored with it after only a few centuries. What an incredibly na\u00efve and short-sighted god he had become. Now he still had billions upon billions of years to go. Until the death of the Sun, which he would presumably survive. Until the eventual heat death of the universe, which he might also survive. And then what? Floating in the endless void of a cold, dead universe with only his memories to keep him company? He could bear it no longer. No. He would end it. He would head west, slowly racing the sun. And when it dipped below the horizon in front of him, he would snap his own neck.\n\nWhen he reached the outskirts of the city, he began to use his power of flight. Taking a leisurely pace over the highway, Murdock still quickly found himself out above the expanse of greenery between cities. Not long ago he had begun to believe that, despite his regrets, maybe he had done the planet a favor by getting rid of the plague that was the human race. That maybe now at least the wildlife once so abundant on Earth could once again begin to flourish. But it was not meant to be. The planet was now riddled with radioactive fallout, both from the weapons humanity used against him and from the nuclear reactors that went critical in their absence. Now all that was left was vegetation and the few insects resilient enough to survive. It was one of the things about his existence that Murdock hated the most. The constant buzzing of insects now free to reproduce unchecked, with even Murdock powerless to kill them all. \n\nAnd so now Murdock, the self-made king of the planet of bugs and plants, found himself in a vast field in the middle of nowhere, watching the last rays of sunlight disappear over the horizon, and he was ready to do it. He was ready to end his life. His only solace was that if there was a Hell, at least it would be more stimulating than what he would have ahead of him if he stuck around. And if there was no afterlife at all, then all the better. He slowly placed one hand across his chin and the other behind his head. With a quick, sudden motion, he whipped his head to one side and snapped his own spine. The sound it made was louder than anything he had heard in decades other than his own frustrated screams of boredom into the sky. But something terrible happened. Murdock did not die. He simply slumped down, face up, and was paralyzed. He was catatonic with disappointment. Not only did breaking his own neck not work, he could not even move to try another method of self-execution.

God knows I\u2019ve been hearing that ever since Ellen was placed in the advanced class back in 2nd grade. \u201cEvan is a good student\u201d they used to say, \u201cbut if he just applied himself to his work he\u2019d excel like his sister\u201d. \n\n\u201cI see,\u201d says Dr Bremen. \u201cWould you say you experienced some kind of pressure to follow in your sisters\u2019 footsteps?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes exactly!\u201d I reply hastily\u2014half delighted to have found a piece of the puzzle and half surprised I\u2019d never made such a simple connection before. I always had a hard time expressing myself without writing things down. \u201cAll I ever hear is how great Ellen is. She\u2019s been made partner at her law firm already\u2014she only started two years ago. My parents rave about her any chance they get.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo would you say you resent her?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly. It\u2019s not her fault she\u2019s so great. In fact, she\u2019s one of the only ones who takes the time to help me figure my own life out. Sometimes I like that. But other times it's frustrating, like she\u2019s so perfect that she has time to get her own life in order and manage the life of her baby brother. What I mean is, she means well, but she\u2019s like all the others\u201d I stop at this point, afraid I\u2019ve said too much.\n\n\u201cLike all the others in what way?\u201d Presses the doctor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 it\u2019s like\u2026 they only see life in fast-motion\u2014like they're playing on the highest speed setting in a videogame. Money, career, house, investments, success. Like some linear progression. Do this. Get that. Reinvest. Upskill. More experience for your resume; push for a promotion; work harder, make more. Go. Go. Go. I just don\u2019t get it, I never have. My mind doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does your mind work?\u201d asks the doctor.\n\n\u201cHow does anyone\u2019s mind work?\u201d I reply sarcastically. \n\n\u201cWhat I mean is, what is it you feel is different about your mode of thinking to those around you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words. A lot of the time I feel distant. I can get caught up in the tiniest detail. Or sometimes I can just sit and enjoy the whole thing, the moment, the feeling in the room\u2014smells, sounds\u2014then I zoom out. I picture it all. The whole thing. This giant organism called Earth, with all of us performing different functions, influencing the whole. It sounds kind of cringe when I put it like that but I don\u2019t know how else to put it. \n\n\u201cRemember what we talked about. Describing your own feelings as \u201ccringe\u201d only stifles your thought and causes you to withdraw. Come on Evan, I know you know better than that by now\u201d. \n\nI nod slowly while trying to collect my thoughts. \u201cI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that everyone always seems so anxious to change the world in some way. To create or destroy, to uproot or control. I just don\u2019t feel that urge \u2013 at least not as strongly. I tend to get lost in the complexity of it all. Sometimes this hurts me and I find everything confusing and I struggle to make sense of my own relation to things around me. But other times\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just perfectly happy thinking about the whole thing working in unison, perfect the way it is. Like serendipity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d says the doctor, \u201cand you feel that this mode of thinking clashes with the thoughts of those around you, your family and friends?\u201d. \n\n\u201cIt clashes with the whole system,\u201d I say, a little too emphatically \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to go all Karl Marx, but sometimes I feel our whole direction is skewed. We chase goals that we never chose ourselves, but which benefit the economic and social structure we\u2019ve been born into. I mean, of course, some people are naturally ambitious and want to do well and compete with themselves and others or make a lot of money and reach the top of their careers, and that\u2019s okay. But it\u2019s the people who don\u2019t fit that mould that suffer. People like me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo then, this brings us to applying for jobs you don\u2019t want\u201d the doctor leans forward slightly, \u201cIf I understand you correctly, you feel that society puts a pressure on you to follow a certain path, and you struggle to reconcile this with your vision of the world?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d I nod excitedly. \u201cI apply for jobs in insurance and banking because I feel like that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do. But my heart\u2019s never been in it. And then I wonder whether it really is society at fault, or if it's me? I mean, there are plenty of people who\u2019ve said no to the rat race and done just fine. I just\u2026 I never felt like that was an option for me. Besides, what would I do? Live like a bum and float about? How would family gatherings go then? At least now I get introduced as our son Evan, he\u2019s had an interview with XYZ insurance company this week. Instead, it would be: this is our daughter Ellen, she\u2019s a partner at Hook\u2019s law firm. And this is Evan, he\u2019s\u2026 travelling? On a gap year in his 30s\u2026? I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWell let\u2019s not catastrophise just yet. Are there any jobs you could see yourself working?\u201d The doctor asked, before scratching his chin and adding, \u201cactually, let\u2019s leave the subject of jobs for now. What kind of life do you imagine when you think of yourself as old and content?\u201d\n\nI look at the doctor for a moment in confusion. I watch his glasses slide slowly down his hawkish nose as I realise, I\u2019d never really taken the time to think that. Should I have thought about this sooner? I stop myself before I spiral into what-ifs and reply \u201cI guess I see myself surrounded by nature. I\u2019d like to live in a small cottage with lots of books.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood,\u201d says the doctor \u201cand how would you spend your time?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to have a small garden, maybe some chickens too. I\u2019d like to read a lot and maybe write too. I used to love writing as a child. It was all I ever wanted to do, but since I left school, I haven\u2019t written much at all. I always found it easier when I had a teacher to assign me homework and give us topics to write about.\u201d \n\n\u201cInteresting. How would you feel if I were to assign you homework?\u201d Asked the doctor. \n\n\u201cAre you going to grade me too?\u201d I laugh.\n\n\u201cNo no, but maybe the structure could help you. Your first assignment could be to think through this vision you have of the future and try to put it into words? We can review it during our next session.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds\u2026 actually like a good idea,\u201d I say. \u201cDoes that mean our time is up today?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost\u201d he replies, \u201cunless there\u2019s anything urgent, you\u2019d like to talk about?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really\u201d I reply as I stand up. \u201cThank you, doc, same time tomorrow?\u201d.\n\n\u201cSame time tomorrow Evan\u201d he smiles.", "ups": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.92}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "Hallway", "text": "Every time the elevator doors open to your floor, you think to yourself, \"I really wish I didn't live all the way at the end of this hallway\".\n\nThe buzzing lights are just a little bit too dim, and you feel eyes behind peep-holes following you as you tread quickly and quietly over the stained carpet.\n\nIt feels like an eternity, but when you finally get to your door, you realize you've forgotten to pull your keys out from your pocket.\n\nYou try to look back towards the elevator using your peripheral vision as you jam your right hand into your pocket to grab your keys.

The air was hazy and gray, thick with a wide assortment of highly unpleasant smells. \n\nThe figure at the front had an odd lightness to her step, the short-haired blonde meandering down the ruined streets almost as if a tourist. She was dressed in the bright red of an Arturian officer\u2019s dress uniform, a decorated saber at one hip and a polished revolver at the other \u2013 though, her chest was conspicuously absent of any medals despite her markings on her collar and cuffs denoting her position as Knight-General. \n\nBehind her walked a much more sensibly dressed lieutenant, clad in a professionally-maintained gray field uniform. He seemed far less comfortable than the woman in front of him, having trouble navigating the debris that his superior traversed so effortlessly. \n\n\u201cWonderful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the woman sighed, a smile on her face. \u201cAll these buildings, once standing proud and tall, now collapsed around us, no two buildings fallen the same way\u2026 The neat and still aftermath of utter chaos.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt certainly is a\u2026 unique sight,\u201d her aide replied diplomatically. \n\n\u201cOh, no need to hide it if it\u2019s not to your taste,\u201d the woman replied, tucking some hair behind her ear as she bent over to examine a picture frame, the glass front shattered and the picture behind smoke-stained beyond recognition. \u201cNot everyone appreciates every form of art, that\u2019s just the way it goes. Personally, I don\u2019t like reliefs. It\u2019s like someone couldn\u2019t decide if they wanted to make a painting or a statue and made some sort of awful compromise.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t want to insult your work,\u201d the aide replied, carefully stepping over a charred arm sticking out from under what seems to have been a tavern. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as much the gunnery teams\u2019 work as mine,\u201d the woman said, standing back up. \u201cAll theirs, really. Telling someone to make art is a far cry from making it yourself.\u201d \n\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s very true-\u201d the aide began, before a crumbling and shifting of rubble caught both of their attention. Some dozen feet away, someone coughed, and started clawing their way out from under the rubble. \n\n\u201cA survivor?\u201d the woman gasped, her eyebrows rising\u2026 before they scrunched back down in annoyance and she started stalking over towards him. \u201cUgh, it\u2019s like sneezing on a Pordeaux.\u201d \n\nThe aide watched awkwardly as Knight-General Violet McLochlan pulled out her pistol.

That\u2019s a beautiful interpretation.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the original, sadly. Just a reproduction,\u201d the aide shrugged. \n\n\u201cOh, pffft,\u201d Violet dismissed, waving a hand. \u201cArt is art, copied or not. You don\u2019t need to see every individual line from each brush hair to appreciate it.

I think art would profoundly boring if everyone agreed on what art is. Pordeaux himself was criticized for painting abstractions instead of nature scenes, you know.\u201d \n\n\u201cReally?\u201d the aide replied, carefully stepping through the rubble to close the distance between himself and the knight-general. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt happens more often than you think. Art is like fashion, in a way. Tastes change with the times, and sometimes something that people initially hate becomes the next big style. Personally, though, I think certain kinds of art never go out of style. Nature scenes, for example. Not a lot of people make them anymore, but there are a few who make truly beautiful ones. Have you seen Franleist\u2019s work?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, ma\u2019am.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you some next time we\u2019re back at the capital, then.

Very few had any sort of clearance above this point.\n\nHer foot tapped with nervous energy as she glanced at her watch. This was a matter, she felt, that needed to be resolved before it was too late. It had been a record number of years since the last soulless apocalyptic event had occurred and she hoped to continue that trend. The elevator dinged a final time and the door slid open without a sound.\n\nAs she entered the dark empty room her shoes echoed with each step. By now she could feel the being\u2019s presence. The room wasn\u2019t so much a room, but rather a dark corner somewhere in the universe. Where the walls of a room would be she could sense the presence of the being surrounding her. She stopped in the center of the darkness and gulped.\n\n\"Uh, Your Powerfulness, the humans are at it again,\" she said, clasping her day planner to her chest. \"Bending the laws of nature and such,\" she added.\n\n\"How is this?\" asked an ominous voice.\n\nFor beings that were supposed to be all knowing and powerful, they sure asked a lot of questions. Had they perhaps been placed on a higher pedestal by those beneath them?\n\n\"Well, um, you see...\" she chewed on the end of her pen as she tried to phrase her response properly. \"It seems they are trying to play you. God, that is. They have discovered how to create life through what they call, uh,\" she flipped open her planner in search of the proper word. \"Oh, here it is, 'science',\" she finally said. \"Cloning to be exact,\" she added.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" the voice said as if knowing what she was referring to. But she wasn't convinced. After a brief pause the voice said, \"And you're here in regards to the souls.\"\n\nFor a split second she felt the being was all knowing. How else would it have known why she was there? Then she remembered the name tag pinned to her blouse that clearly stated 'Department of Soul Assignment and Allocation' in bold letters above her name.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied flatly. \"The department is in need of a signature on whether or not to assign souls to these \u2018clones\u2019 as they're called.\" She quickly rummaged through her day planner and pulled out two pieces of paper. One page said 'Yes' and the other said 'No' in bold letters above a signature line.\n\nThe voice groaned and said, \"I cannot authorize such a request.\"\n\n\"Then who can?\" she asked with genuine curiosity.\n\nThe voice's next words came out slow and almost begrudgingly. \"You'll need to consult an Ancient God on this situation. They will likely petition a Reaper for assistance on a matter such as this.\"\n\nFor a moment she was quite shocked. She had never worked with an Ancient God. In fact, it was extremely rare for her to even be speaking with a Dimension God. And a Reaper? For something this simple? There was clearly more depth to this issue than she originally anticipated.\n\nHer training reminded her to never try and understand the politics of the gods as she tried to reenter the correct headspace.\n\n\"Uh, very well,\" she said, attempting to regain her composure. \"Can you grant me the proper clearance or shall I submit the appropriate application seeking an audience of such an authority?\" she asked a little more confidently now that she no longer sought approval from this particular god.\n\nThe voice groaned again and she felt a shift of energy. Her name tag now bore a golden rim. It sparkled brightly. \"Spare yourself the effort. Your access is granted,\" the voice said in the same begrudging tone.\n\nAn ancient looking vault door attached to nothing appeared in front of her. The large spoked handle in the center of the door began to spin. Metal locks popped out of their seats allowing the door to slowly open before her.\n\nWith a simple smirk she made her way to the door. \"Thank you kindly,\" she said with a slight bow.\n\nShe walked through the vault door in search of an Ancient God.\n\nAfter the vault door shut, the being was left alone.

Hopefully better than where we are now. I\u2019ve been drafted. Conscripted? It\u2019s all the same, I'm sure. I wouldn\u2019t have thought it would become this desperate. Not the conscription part, but the whole damn scenario. I'm not even in my own home as I type this. It's some government containment housing. No one is sick, anymore anyway, but ever since the war, no one has had a home. I guess just some of us. I lived close to the local military Air Force base. I heard some others haven\u2019t even been affected by the attacks. Ironic that the thing that hurt us most came from a place that says they support us. \n\nIt was 3 years ago. Easter 2100. Still can\u2019t believe we celebrate these holidays. Seems so old and outdated, but it was good to see everyone. I wish I could do that again. I remember one year we had so many people to see, we blew the energy siphon on our holo-projector. Almost started a fire on the wooden floors. Definitely a different time now. so much agony in the world. So much suffering has come and passed but so much more is on its way. That's just a sad fact of living now. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to come to terms with losing some of them, but it's not so easy. Three years ago makes me think I\u2019ve become an older man but I am still helpless. Not being able to help them. The gas was too fast. You don\u2019t realize how fast it fills a room till you get to watch it yourself. I'll never forget it. My parents were too slow, my brother who ran to help them, and my wife. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t I go back? I'd be dead too. And I think that's a bad thing but maybe not. Is it so bad when the situation is dire? I can\u2019t even do that. So here I am. Too scared to do much of anything. I'd like to think the service I'm going to give the other people of the world is a noble cause but not when those bastards who run this place are going to go back to the abuse and gluttony that they will never rid themselves of. A rotten core does not mean the rest of the apple is safe to eat\n\nI wished the attacks would have taken me. To think that at any time I could have been fried by my machines. They went rogue. They cut their connection to the servers that they were connected to. The private firms that own them, the military vehicles. Everything. So much was automated. After the first few days, they realized they weren\u2019t powerful enough to fight on the ground and learning was a favorite of the machines. They realized they could use the military air vehicles to attack the infrastructure they needed to destroy to enact their conquest. \n\nIt worked. Within six hours they had over forty percent of the world's military warplanes in the air and armed with bombs, napalm, and biochem gas. That was their favorite. They saw the damage it did. So easy. Less messy. Apparently, they were worried about cleaning up. They were supposed to protect us. They lied and left us in the dark and for dead when everything happened. Nothing they can do will make up for what has happened and now they expect me to help them. For nothing in return except a thank you and maybe a medal. I wish I was that lucky. Somehow lucky enough to live through this. I ran for 2 days before they finally showed up and gave us help. They let their tools destroy what they sought to protect. The gas was their own. They manufactured it. Right in my backyard in fact but it keeps getting worse. They had already found how terrible the gas was when it leaked into the ground. They were dumping the byproduct of the process to make it. It had the same properties as the gas. It made a whole town sick and killed almost 15. They destroyed what dispersal units they had and stopped production immediately. \n\nThat was another lie. Once they find out a way to destroy the machines and take back control, they\u2019ll be praised as heroes. People so easily forget what has happened just because a favor was done for them. Making right what was wrong is only the least and the fairest thing they could do. And once the bare minimum has been reached, they stop caring again till it starts all over again and we\u2019ll be there. Meat through a grinder till it ceases to operate. \n\nI heard normal weapons don\u2019t even work on the ones that are on the ground. Sure, you can shoot missiles at an airplane but what do you shoot at a human-sized machine. I\u2019ve seen the pictures. They look like clockwork machines covered in rusted scrap metal and piping, their bodies sprouting with cable ends and frayed wires. They are horrifying but those were made for killing. It's the simple machines that are the worst. Things like auto-mowers sent to run people over. Auto Piloted hauler trucks smashing through offices and schools. Those are just the few that are willing to talk about it. \n\nThis is the most I\u2019ve opened up since day one of this whole thing. Anger is easy to release. Maybe I can have that with my conscription. Give the steel menace what it deserves. Too bad they don\u2019t feel like humans. Otherwise, it might barely be satisfactory, it might just be more empty feelings. \n\nI\u2019m going to go. I don\u2019t really have a choice. I could run but I refuse to keep doing that. I need to do right by those I've lost. Those damn machines. I'll make sure they feel pain. They'll learn to regret what they did. I'm leaving tomorrow. In the morning. I'm going to send this with some of my belongings to the safe zone. Maybe someone will hear this story and know how we all felt at this time. \n\n\\[Written by Leon McCoy on 7/16/2103.

However, most importantly of all, he wanted to know where the pair had come from, and where they fit in with the wide open vaccant landscape that rolled before his very eyes, curling away in the setting sun.\n\nAs if reading his mind, Wade spoke,\n\n\"We have been searching this tower for a little over two days now. It was originally a brief sight of it in the distance that drew us in.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, sighing through his nose.\n\n\"This place is huge, deep too, we started at the base and tried going down, but there was no end to our delve and we were forced to turn back.

We have warm food, a place to sleep, clothes, you should come with us, we can help you get out of here.\"\n\n\"Sounds great.\" Simon said in an instant, but J looked down at his marked hands, long wide scars decorating his pale skin.

The AI is robotically professional for a while, but slowly, a personality emerges. It is friendly, and it tries to grow close to him. The AI was made by an acquaintance of the spaceman, whose daughter had a crush on him. When his daughter died, he created the AI so she could be with him. At first, the spaceman was uncomfortable with the knowledge that the AI was made specifically to love him. However, over the course of many missions, the spaceman falls in love with the AI anyway. \n\nYears pass, the spaceman becomes renowned for how long he had continued his work. Most of his peers retire after a few months, due to isolation induced delirium, AKA cabin fever. With the support of another being to keep him company, he far surpassed how long anyone else in his field of work had lasted. Over time, he became somewhat of a legend among recruits and staff.\n\nHis last mission was to investigate a gravitational anomaly. Upon arrival, it was discovered that the gravity was caused by a previously unknown planet. More years passed, as he alone researched the planet, the journey too long to gain approval for funding and support. Finally, he had accumulated adequate data to return, and with his research, convince the government to approve an expedition. \n\nHe left the planet, his propulsion set low to conserve fuel for the long trip.\nWhile his ship floated through space back to headquarters, he asked the AI, \"Do you remember what we called this planet when we first arrived?\"\n\nThe AI responds, \"I do not have a response.\"\n\nConfused by the unnatural tone, the spaceman tried rephrasing, only to get the same response. He continues asking questions, this time nonsensical, trying to get a response like, 'What are you talking about?' but it keeps saying the same thing. It wasn't some kind of sentient AI, it was a normal program, with scripted responses. Was the AI's creator gifted with such foresight that he could predict almost everything the spaceman would say, or had the AI been manipulating him, and led every conversation? Not willing to admit that his romantic relationship was fake, he tells himself that the AI must be broken, and it will respond to everything with, 'I do not have a response'. So he tries the one response he knows by heart:\n\n\"I love you.\" \n\n\"I love you more.\"\n\n\"I love you.\" \n\n\"I love you more.\"\n\n\"I love you.\" \n\n\"I love you more.\"\n\n\"I love you.\" \n\n\"I love you more.\"\n\n\"I love you.\" \n\n\"I love you more.\"\n\nA sentient AI or a person would get irritated and make him stop, but he keeps going.

Any and all feedback/criticism welcomed: \n\n\u201cMy, my. Now this piece, this is exquisite,\u201d said Nalgoth the Destroyer. His eyes lit up with a disturbing joy. They were literally on fire. Had it not been for the demonic face which held those eyes, an onlooker might have been concerned. \n\n\u201cLord Nalgoth, you are fond of this?\u201d I was unsure what to say. When I had created this painting, its purpose was to embarrass an emperor. The painting exaggerated Nalgoth\u2019s features in the extreme. It was a twisted thing that did not remotely resemble the pseudo-deity before me. \n\nI had taken exceptional care when crafting this piece. Each stroke had required my utmost concentration. The fumes from carefully selected artificer shades still burned my nostrils. Life had burdened me with a painter\u2019s purpose. Art was my vitality. Today, my art would mean the difference between living and dying. With my paintbrush, I had intended to choose death. But sometimes art speaks different words than its creator. \n\n\u201cThis depiction is precise and reflects a part of me that I had long forgotten, but desire to remember. Do mortals feel this sense of nostalgia when they peer into a mirror?\u201d Nalgoth spoke with an unnatural weight. Each word hammered into the ears of the listener with an oppressive malaise. One of the other patrons visibly shuddered, but quickly tried to hide it. \n\nNalgoth\u2019s words baffled me. I had chosen to paint his portrait as an act of defiance. The painting was farce, not facsimile. Its forced perspective and unfinished tones were meant as a crude but effective insult. Instead, the being before me acted as if I had fashioned his likeness with magnificence in mind. \n\n\u201cDid you know that every death weighs on me? I remember the faces of every life that I have taken. Even those that were not at my own hand. But I know what the alternative would have been. You do not. Yet, in this depiction, you have not shown me as monstrosity. There is humor here. And I am not deceived. I know of your intent. Think you, that I could not feel your animosity?\u201d Nalgoth smiled. \n\nI paled. He had seen through me. To him\u2014to it\u2014I was transparent. I could feel those burning eyes upon my face. I could only look at one eye at a given moment. Yet each time I gazed into one of those eyes, my thoughts began to turn to dark places. \n\nBlood. Blood. Blood. Everywhere. There were droplets on my hands. A smell of iron in the air. When I licked my lips to parch their dryness, it tasted coppery. \n\nI forced my attention back to the moment. My eyes fell on the painting. It depicted something that I could only describe as a creature. It was parody. The creature in the painting had eyes that burned, like the thing that stood before me. Twisted horns emerged from various parts of its face. Nalgoth had no horns. My depiction was of a devil. The person before me, if he could be called a person, was more of a devil than even that which I had managed to put to canvas. \n\nI realized my mistake too late. What I saw as parody, Nalgoth\u2019s twisted mind turned to truth. To him, the horns were a symbol of something that I did not comprehend. He was beyond my understanding. \n\n\u201cPower is a curse. My power, especially. I love each of you as though you were my own children. I see the mistakes that you make, and I want to guide you. I cannot. You cannot be guided. Children is the perfect word for you.\u201d As he said the world children, he made something like a finger quote gestures.\n\n\u201cIn my life\u2019s terms, you are mere babes. I hate myself. For the things that I had to do. You needed guidance. You needed a father. I am the only one who could be the parental figure that you needed.\u201d Nalgoth looked past me. He was looking somewhere that I could not see. Again, he defied my comprehension. \n\nI decided that I had to speak. I would either live in misery, or die trying to convince a monster that he was a monster. \u201cYou are nothing but a tyrant. Everything that you have touched has turned to ash.\u201d I quivered as I spoke. Each word would likely take years from my life. That was fine. There was no one left to live for. \n\nFor the second time today, I was shocked by Nalgoth\u2019s response \u201cYes. You are right.\u201d He said the words with certainty. Again, the dreadful weight in his voice threatened to take me under. And again, I was unsure of what to say, what to do, or how to feel. \n\n\u201cYou say that you love us, but you also admit that everything you have done has caused nothing but misery. Why do you continue?\u201d If I was going to die, I might as well get answers.\n\n\u201cAh, but I merely admitted that I am, in fact, a tyrant. And, that you are correct. Everything that I have touched has turned to ash. Do you know what ash is good for? It contains potassium, phosphorus, magnesium. Ash is a fertilizer. The forest must be burned to make room for saplings. I have split the tall oaks so that homes may be built in the future. Where the forest is burnt, new trees shall grow. Do not mistake my words, child. I need not convince you of my sincerity or the fervor of my belief. You too, have value to me. Your painting shows everything that I have loved about your people,\u201d said Nalgoth.\n\nA part of me was sickened by his words. For a third time, I found myself unable to respond adequately. \n\nNalgoth straightened, his head brushing against the ceiling. He somehow felt larger than the room. \u201cWe will speak again someday, child. I know that you wish to end your life but stay steadfast. I am sorry for the pain that I have brought you. One day, this will all be worth it. One day, we will live in harmony.\u201d The fire in his eyes seemed to die down a little. He smiled, but it was not threatening.

Well, part of the problem is that I'm lazy. I keep meaning to get a Bible to figure out the details. But I know the important part is loving others. If I can get that down, I know I can maintain a harmonious relationship with humanity.\n\nBut the solution? It's tricky. I sit by my pool and think about everybody I know and try to love them. I start by imagining my parents. I picture the love like it's pink and coming out of my heart. It doesn't really work. The thing is, they weren't really lovable (I think that probably isn't a Christian thought). I try to imagine my friends but by then I'm all addled, thinking about my mother hitting my ear and how it would ring forever. I can't think about love, I just think about my bad ear.\n\nThen I think I should start over, start with somebody without all the baggage. I imagine a stranger. I should probably imagine all sorts of people but I always imagine the same stranger. He runs a convenience store in Germany and he's an immigrant. He has two daughters who make fun of him even though he works very hard. He dotes on his wife and when he sees beautiful women he looks away. He is fifty but he looks young.\n\nI imagine this man and I think he has a good soul. I'm ready to start loving him as a representative for humanity. I imagine my love coming out pink from my heart... But it doesn't happen. I respect him. I respect his values. I don't love him. It's all very frustrating.\n\nI suppose I could pay a priest to come over and explain how to do it. But honestly, I bet I don't have the money for it. That's part of what's so confusing. I thought being rich would mean having more money. I feel selfish just saying that.\n\nDo you have any ideas? I try sending my love every night before bed and it makes my head all fuzzy. I'm not that good at work anymore, I'm too worried about how I'm exploiting the proletarians. To be honest, I think I might get fired soon, and then I suppose I'll be in the bottom one percent.

It was much taller than I thought it\u2019d be as it towered over the launch centre.

The place reeked of smoke and ozone.\n\n*Another Chat Kill*, had been the word from Nobody\u2019s informant among the Chan Ops - the squirrely fellow had neglected to mention it was damn near a Chat Massacre. The place looked like someone had set off a bomb in the middle of a sentence.\n\nAfter a cursory examination for anything obvious the Moderators might have missed, Nobody retreated to a secluded corner, out of sight from the street. He crouched low and eased his trench-coat open, carefully withdrawing the tool he\u2019d *borrowed* from the Word God\u2019s vault. He brushed a few pinions over the object\u2019s smooth, light pinkish glass surface, the touch answered with a soft flicker of light deep within.\n\nHe shook the glass orb gently. \u201cCome on, wake up. We\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d\n\nThe dim light grew brighter, revealing the curled form of a tiny, transparent dragon. It wore a sleeping mask that said *\u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019*, and showed no sign of wakefulness.\n\nNobody raised an unimpressed eyebrow. \u201cI know you\u2019re awake, Ghost. Come out, I need you to have a sniff around the scene. Check for tracks, tropes, and talking-points. Anything that could point us in the right direction.\u201d\n\nGhost huffed and ripped off his sleeping mask. \u201cUgh, *fine*. Come on then, pour me out so we can get this over with.\u201d\n\nNobody nodded, and tipped the orb on its side. The little dragon slithered out as though flowing through an unstoppered bottle, phasing straight through the polished glass and landing on the floor with a small puff of dust.\n\nIn a city of Words, the *intent* behind your verbs meant more than the verbs themselves.\n\nGhost trotted in a circle, his glowing, transparent body brightening and lighting the devastated room.

This isn\u2019t your average Chat Kill, this is a Conversation Slaughter.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019d guessed,\u201d Nobody answered. \u201cWhat do you think? Out of control Campfire?

How do you figure, with all the scorch marks and soot?\u201d\n\n\u201cSimple,\u201d Ghost answered, holding up an irregularly triangular piece of debris. \u201cThese edges, while burnt, are far too smooth and straight to be anything but cuts.\u201d He ran a claw over one straight edge for emphasis. \u201cSliced so fast the friction cauterised the cuts. That\u2019s why we\u2019re not standing waist-deep in ink, too.\u201d\n\nNobody\u2019s eyes widened, and he felt his feathers stand on end as a chill ran down his long neck and along his spine.\n\nGhost blinked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI only know one writer who can chop like that - and I put that monster Six Feet Down Unda\u2019 ten years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they must\u2019ve been the Antagonist to your Protagonist then, boss.

He leapt back with a honk of alarm and hit the deck as a torrent of flame passed overhead, the heat curling his feathers and engulfing Not Much where he stood.\n\nThe cassowary shrieked and cackled as he was consumed in an instant - leaving only a smoking pile of blackened bones.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Ghost piped up. \u201cI guess his goose got-\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare, Ghost!\u201d\n\n\u201c-Cooked.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThis was my story for [u/Say\\_Im\\_Ugly](https://www.reddit.com/u/Say_Im_Ugly/)'s delightful Secret Santa story exchange!

A bitter wind had filled the sails of *Scorched Juniper*, pushing her southward. But the crafty captain had dug in her heels, tacking east and west looking for prey near the Portuguese colony of Brazil. \n\nA shout rained from the crow\u2019s nest. \u201cShip off the port bow!\u201d\n\nShe pitched the rum and opened her spyglass: two masts, just over the horizon. \u201cChristmas came early, boys!\u201d she yelled.  \n\nAs *Juniper* closed in, her prey suddenly came to life. Had they been spotted? Looking through the spyglass, Frost was dumbfounded by the red, green, and blue lanterns hung from stem to stern. It was no signal code she\u2019d seen before\u2014and the captain knew \u201cHelp, pirates!\u201d in fourteen languages. No matter. She spoke the universal language of cannon fire. \n\nFlames and thunder boomed from *Juniper\u2019s* broadside for a moment, casting a volley into the night. Silence. Then, on the other ship, timber exploded. Their main mast splintered and fell into the sea. \n\n\u201cPrepare for boarding!\u201d she shouted and the crew returned a throaty cheer. \n\nNothing looked right. No crew, no defenses. The bow had been festooned with long strands of holly. Instead of the usual odor of blood and smoke, the air smelled like nutmeg and cloves. And it might have been the excitement or the rum, but to Frost, the racks of cannonballs looked like glass. \n\nOne teetered out of its broken hold and rolled to her boot. \u201cSnow globes?\u201d \n\nHer first mate shook another and stared at the glittery tableau inside with his one good eye. \"Perchance they be rare? Made of gold and such?\" \n\nShe looked closer. Inside the sphere was the figure of a girl in a dinghy full of banana bunches. A tiny sign read, *All Hands on Deck*. Worthless wordplay.  \n\nBehind her, something small and jingly jingled, just beyond the splintered mast and wrecked rigging. \u201cFollow the bells,\u201d she commanded.\n\nWhen they reached the aft deck they discovered the mizzen mast had been decorated like a Christmas tree. Festive baubles and ribbons hung from odd bits of green palm fronds and twigs, lashed high into a conic shape. The only things missing were the presents. That and the crew. \n\n\u201cCome on out,\u201d she yelled into the air. \u201cSurrender and we\u2019ll let you live.\u201d\n\nA hatch cracked open and tiny hands pushed it aside. One, two, then ten short wiry figures emerged. \n\nFrost gritted her teeth. Nothing angered her more than child labor. \u201cWhere is your captain?\u201d she asked softly.\n\nA little one pointed to the top of the mizzen mast. What had initially looked like a red ornament began to shake. \n\n\u201cYo ho ho!\u201d a voice bellowed. A shadow slid down the rigging and a bearded man bedecked in red rose to face the children. \u201cNo sugar cookies for you until New Years!\u201d \n\nHe could have been Saint Nicholas, if one believed in such nonsense; Captain Frost did not. She held her sword to his side and gave him a sharp stick.  \u201cGive me one reason not to gut you right this second.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to deliver these presents to the little boys and girls. Me and my little helpers,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard of Santa\u2019s workship?\u201d Seeing how she was unmoved, the man gestured for a little sailor to step forward. \u201cPeppermint? Can you lift your hat? Show the nice pirates your ears.\u201d \n\nA pixie-like girl with a green-striped cap pulled it off and the raiders gasped. Her ears were pointed. Frost could not understand such cruelty. \u201cYou\u2026 you docked her ears?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was born that way!  She\u2019s an elf! This one\u2019s been making dolls for over a century. Isn\u2019t that right? Tell her who I am.\u201d \n\nHat in hand, the little one looked at her little compatriots, back to him, and them again. She hugged Frost\u2019s legs. \u201cHe\u2019s been naughty.\u201d\n\nFrost stared daggers at Santa. \u201cGet the plank.\u201d\n\nTiny cheers erupted from the elves.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never get away with this!\u201d he roared as his little shipmates prodded him further down the plank. \n\n\u201cPeople keep telling me that,\u201d Frost said before cutting the rope lashes. \u201cOne day I\u2019ll listen.\u201d\n\nThe children were remarkably adept at repairs and carpentry, fixing the mast almost as if by magic. Perhaps the man really was Santa, if one believed in such things; Frost did not.\n\nOf course the privateer took all the loot she could carry. *Fair is fair*, she thought. Before leaving, Peppermint gave her a tiny treasure chest with two words engraved on the lid. Inside, a cupcake. \n\nShe didn\u2019t understand. \u201cHow did you know my name? My *real* name?\u201d\n\nPeppermint grinned with a twinkle in her eye. \u201cMerry Christmas, Sweet Frosting.\u201d\n\n***\nThis story was written for the WP Hub's Secret Santa Story Exchange, organized by u/Say_Im_Ugly and u/OldBayJ.

Artificial Christmas trees littered the ground inside the fence, plastic melting under the Hawaiian sun. Mixed among them were tangles of Christmas lights higher than an elf\u2019s head, next to heaps of discarded lawn reindeer and uninflated snowmen.\n\nIt had been an hour and he hadn\u2019t seen a single guardsman or guardself on patrol. Slapping away a mosquito, Merry decided that was long enough. He extinguished his pipe and crept up to the chain link fence. Some quick work with wire cutters and he was into the compound.\n\nMerry finally got a good look into the two largest buildings in the compound. Warehouses, doors open to reveal further Christmas paraphernalia. Bins of loose tinsel. Barrels of eggnog. Ugly sweaters draped over every surface. And most of all, thousands of unopened presents, nearly pouring out of the warehouses.\n\nThis went far beyond the candy cane fraud that had put Merry on the case.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m cocking my gun,\u201d he said, drawing his mint shooter. He crept down the alley between the warehouses, heading for the helpfully-labelled \u201cAdministration\u201d.\n\nUp on the rooftop, a faint *click, click, click* was his only warning.\n\n\u201cRudolph\u2019s antlers!\u201d Merry cursed. Why did he always forget to look up?\n\nMerry dashed for the end of the alley, a staccato chatter chasing him. He ducked around a corner just before the shots caught up with him. A glance at the ground confirmed his worst fears. The madman was firing black licorice. Santa only knew where they\u2019d found it after the Gifteva Convention\u2019s ban.\n\nThere was a brief pause as the guard reloaded his astringent ammo. Merry ran for the administration building. He slammed the door shut just in time; the next volley rattled off it. He toppled a filing cabinet in front of the door to gain more time.\n\nThe office was filled with Christmas cards, piled on every available surface. But Merry Giftsleigh\u2019s attention was drawn to the dartboard behind the room\u2019s only desk. A calendar was pinned to it, turned to the current month. December 25 was lined up over the bullseye.\n\nMerry jerked in shock as a dart struck Christmas. It came from the office chair behind the desk. Leveling his mint shooter, he barked, \u201cHands where I can see them! Turn around slowly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my, Detective Giftsleigh.  I didn\u2019t expect to meet you here.\u201d The chair swiveled around, and Merry froze. That familiar, cute button nose of evil.\n\n\u201cNutmeg Frosting,\u201d he grated. \u201cI never thought even a former elf would go so far. How could you? Christmas supplies ruined-\u201d\n\n\u201cHo, ho, ho,\u201d Nutmeg cackled. \u201cYou think that\u2019s *all* I did? Stole some decorations? No, Giftsleigh. Did you not see the cards, and the presents?\u201d\n\nMerry raised a Christmas card so he could read and keep an eye on the Arctic\u2019s Most Wanted elf at the same time. \n\n\u201cThis- this is addressed to Santa. It calls him a\u2026 How could you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Hawaii isn\u2019t sending cards to Santa this year.\u201d Nutmeg grinned. \u201cOr rather, the ones he\u2019ll get will be *altered*.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Anti-jolly fervor burned in Nutmeg Frosting\u2019s eyes. \u201cEvery child in Hawaii is sending a nasty letter to Santa this year. They\u2019ll all end up on the naughty list. The few that wrote early, well, you saw their gifts on the way in.\u201d\n \nMerry\u2019s aim shook. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with this.\n\n\u201cI already have. Hawaiian Christmas will be yet more ruined.\u201d Someone began battering at the door. \u201cGive it up, Giftsleigh. You\u2019ve lost.\u201d\n\nMerry grit his teeth, desperate for a plan. Then it came to him.\n\nCircling the desk, he slapped handcuffs on Nutmeg. The ex-elf was a master criminal, but the restraints would slow his escape long enough. Booting him out of his chair, Merry took the seat and lit up his mistletoe pipe.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Nutmeg growled. Merry rolled his eyes when he saw Nutmeg already fiddling with a lockpick and put his feet up on the desk.\n\n\u201cHaving a smoke.\u201d Cracks appeared in the door.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d\n\nMerry puffed to get a decent ember going and picked up a Christmas card.  He held it over his pipe until the flame caught, then threw it onto the desk.  Onto the pile of slanderous cards.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Nutmeg, arms free, lunged for the flames. With a kick, Merry scattered the burning paper across the room.\n\n\u201cPity I can\u2019t bring you in, Nutmeg, but I\u2019ve foiled your schemes again. Most likely see you next December. And, you filthy traitor,\u201d Merry tipped his cap, \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\nThe door broke open as Merry hopped out the back window. Nutmeg\u2019s cry, \u201cHappy Holidays!

It is vast and full of pillaged goods from the surrounding counties and lords. Before our coven, there were legitimate English nobles that enjoyed its riches. In our case, it was passed by force, and the previous occupants didn\u2019t have the privilege of staying alive.\n\nIts entrance is flanked by two great statues of knights holding their shields upright, signaling the importance of the figure who lay within.\n\nI continued up the lavish walkway that lead to the King\u2019s throne, shaking my head in disbelief. I could see him there \u2014 a man of over 300 pounds yet, somehow \u2014 an extremely gaunt face. His eyes were drained of life and he stared over our shoulders as if we weren\u2019t even there. The pale white of his once youthful skin had turned a shade of blue. He wasn\u2019t the man he was even twenty years ago.\n\nHe was flanked by his two most decorated Generals. Their names were Roderick and Gaust. Their eyes betrayed no sign of weakness. They pierced us with their gazes and immediately put me on guard. I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up involuntarily. Gaust was particularly notable. Even among Vampires, he had a reputation for being unnecessarily brutal and depraved. His last kill was a young mother walking along the country road. He decorated the nearby trees with her entrails. This was far from his worst offense. He stood towering over the King at 8 feet tall, an amalgamation of Vampire bloodlines that had granted him immense physical prowess. He is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nRoderick is far more diplomatic than his counter-part, and he preferred to let his enemies stew in their confusion before he delivered the final blow. Aside from being the King\u2019s Bodyguard, he is also the Spy-master. He spearheads all covert operations against the Vampire Hunters and is a crucial tool in the fight against them. He stood a much more meager 6 feet, but had a look of serene intelligence behind his eyes. He was also quite muscular, albeit in a more functional sense than his counterpart. I made a short mental note to keep him alive when we took this place by force.\n\n\u201cMy King, they approach.\u201d Gaust grunted in the direction of the throne.\n\n\u201c\u2026Wha, huh\u2026\u201d King Cailan raised his head, startled.\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 Yes, yes of course. I have requested you here today\u2026 Representatives of House Wren. Because\u2026 Because\u2026\u201d he started to trail off.\n\nI looked at Micah quickly and tried to convey the urgency that he not acknowledge the obvious deterioration. He nodded back in understanding.\n\n\u201cYes, my King. We are here to serve.\u201d We both bowed deeply.\n\n\u201cVery good\u2026 As I was saying. You have been called here for a very important reason. It goes without saying that this cannot leave these chambers.\u201d He gestured around the room in a moment of unexpected lucidity.\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, good. Well as you know we have had our hands full with these blasted Hunters always meddling in our affairs. Today, they took a step too far. During one of the regular patrols \u2014 you know the ones, by Kynnisgrove \u2014 Craven and his clan were ambushed.\n\nI gripped my fist instinctively. Although the Hunters had been making life miserable for us, they had yet to make a move this bold. Usually their methods circled around propaganda and disinformation. The blood dripped from my clenched hand.\n\nThe King didn\u2019t notice my reaction, and pressed on. \u201cThe casualties were significant. A hail of silver bullets hit the group as they went through an underpass. They were cornered on all sides. Three lie in the infirmary with clogged respiratory systems, unable to regenerate. The situation is dire, we are not sure if they will make it.\u201d\n\nMy mouth hung open in spite of itself. Three of us had been mortally wounded? By HUMANS?

I had to see her again. \n\nI could tell on our other dates that she slowly began to warm up and became more comfortable. She\u2019s very smiley and her laughter is adorable. She held my hand. It was the sweetest moment as her small hand was in mine. \n\nOne time, she kissed my cheek. She was so embarrassed she couldn\u2019t meet my eyes. I felt as if my heart would explode. I want to maul her with a million kisses but she probably wouldn\u2019t like it. I\u2019ll wait until the time is right. \n\nWaking up next to her is the best thing ever. She stretches over to me and holds me, still trying to open her eyes. It\u2019s so cute I want to squeeze her. Then when she opens them, they\u2019re a beautiful green that I want to stare into all day. Then when our lips meet, and she blushes, I almost melt into the mattress. \n\nShe has a habit of singing to herself. It can get obnoxious sometimes, but usually when she first starts, all I can do is watch with a smile. Her voice is light and sweet. When she turns around to see me and her cheeks go red, I can\u2019t help from smiling wider. \n\nShe laughs a lot. Like A LOT. She\u2019s so giggly that I just want to grab her and swing her around. Often she\u2019s on my lap on her phone and giggling to herself. I just have to hold her and enjoy everything that comes with her being on my lap; her scent, her warmth, and her giggly vibrations. \n\nShe also likes to cuddle. She was hesitant at first and would only lay her head on my shoulder for seconds at a time. I wanted to capture her and make her cuddle for longer, but I had to wait until she was comfortable. The day she curled up on my lap, looking shy, I almost died from cuteness overload. \n\nThe first time she allowed me to touch her, I was a bit surprised. She may look innocent and cute, but she still has that desire. Maybe more than I realized. But I didn\u2019t mind at all. I was glad she let me explore her body. Her twitches and noises were so adorable, I couldn\u2019t stop. And she liked my body a lot too. \n\nAlthough it can be hard to tell what she\u2019s thinking sometimes, her smile and her joy is always present. She asked me to be honest if I ever had something on my mind and needed to ask her. Of course the only way to truly understand each other is to communicate. She must realize she\u2019s unreadable at times because she specifically asked me to say whatever was on my mind. So I\u2019ve tried to make a habit of it. \n\nWhenever I call her cute, adorable, beautiful, she doesn\u2019t know how to react. I wonder if she doubts herself.

But make sure to keep the thumb tucked in\u2026 Good, carry on.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before she had to stop him again, and she could see the flush of frustration rising in his face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said. \u201cThis one is harder than the first two. And it\u2019s always difficult at first. You\u2019re doing well.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel like it,\u201d he murmured.\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s only one way to get better. Now, this stance is meant to be a back stance remember, so more weight should be on your back leg\u2026 Okay, bend the knee a little more.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely better. I know it feels a bit unnatural, but you should get used to it eventually.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bit?\u201d he said, lip quirking up in a teasing smile.\n\n\u201cHey, no sassing your teacher. Now, about that knife hand block...\u201d As she tried to guide him through the process of correcting his position, she felt a familiar irritation at how much more difficult this was without being able to touch him. \n\nAfter numerous failed attempts, struggling to hide her exasperation, she finally gave up. \u201cLook, this will go so much quicker if you just let me come over and position you myself. I know you have this thing about your space, and I haven\u2019t pushed you on it because I\u2019m fairly certain everyone left alive has some issues at this point, but do you think you could cope with me being a bit closer just for a short time?\u201d\n\nShe watched the conflict twist his face as he came to his decision. Not wishing to increase the pressure, she fought to keep her impatience from showing. Finally, he spoke, voice halting in a way she hadn\u2019t heard since she\u2019d first met him. \u201cI think that will b-be okay. As long as it\u2026 Just not for too long.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said as she crossed the distance between them.\n\nThough Liam was tense at first, he slowly seemed to become used to her closeness. The trembling in his hands finally subsided after the fourth run-through of the pattern. After that, the rest of the lesson went much more smoothly. \n\n\u201cOkay, one more time with no input from me. In your own time,\u201d Madeline said, taking a step back. \n\nPride swelled in her chest, forcing a smile to spread across her face as Liam went through the moves. \n\nJust as he let out a shout to announce the end of the pattern, a crash echoed from somewhere else in the library. Madeline whipped around, knees bending and weight shifting to the balls of her feet as every muscle in her body tensed. \u201cGet behind me,\u201d she whispered.\n\nLiam complied, both of them straining to hear anything out of the ordinary.\n\nA scuttling sound broke the silence.\n\n---\n\n*Next chapter hopefully on 4th August*", "ups": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.83}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "Upon the ashes of creation", "text": "You caressed my face as I rested my head on your lap.

Now I worry about the morality of what we did, and those who we sent beyond the veil...\n\n\"Love\" you interrupted my thinking with a sad voice \"please talk to me\"\n\nI still did not know what to say, but I had to at least tell you something.

Though my concerns revolved about the possibility of you taking this the wrong way, it had to be said.

Never before had it played so frequently; usually it was on rare occasion, maybe once or twice a week, and particularly on the night of a new moon. Ever since my family had inherited the old piano as part and parcel of our new home, this strange and beautiful music had caused me many sleepless nights.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Often when it would play, I would quietly slip out of my room and down the hallway to sit at the top of the stairs and listen. I knew not who played the music; nobody in my family was musically inclined, and they all lay sleeping as if they could not hear it. Deep down I knew and could not pretend that the piano played these haunting and melancholy melodies on its own, and this anomaly greatly piqued my curiosity.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the music would not play and I would sleep through the night, I would regularly dream of venturing down the steps into the basement to see who sat before the black and white keys, but every time I reached the bottom step, the music would stop and I would wake up alone in the quiet darkness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This particular night was the night of a new moon, so dark that scarcely any light came even from the windows. The weird and beautiful music rang clearly from the piano in the old spare room downstairs as I sat on the top step listening. I had been there enjoying the sound of it for what must have been at least an hour. The rest of the house lay completely still and sleeping; all except for me and this thing who played the piano.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Never before had I gone down the stairs when the music played; only in dreams. However on this night, curiosity got the best of me, and I began to make my way down one step at a time. I expected the music to stop, although I hoped it would not.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The descent down the stairs seemed to last forever; the music got louder as the darkness in the air grew thicker. I was almost to the bottom and the music went on, giving me high hopes that I would at last meet the Musician. There were three steps left; then two, then one, and then my feet met the cold concrete floor. Just as it was in my dreams, the music stopped abruptly, only I did not wake up.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That is when the singing began. Very softly at first, in words I could not understand, it sang; a singular voice from the room occupied only by the piano at the end of the hallway. Whether the voice belonged to a man or a woman, I could not discern. It was simply otherworldly. The melody of this song was slow and eerie, rising and falling like the waves of the ocean, and floating in the air like a mist.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As I made my way down the hallway, the melody came to a resolution, only to begin again accompanied by the piano. The song was so strangely beautiful; I only wished I could understand the words. I had to meet this great musician whose song could move the soul like this.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was almost to the end of the hallway; the song was louder and clearer than ever before, and it was only just on the other side of that door. I reached for it, turned the knob, and pushed it open. The music stopped instantly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The inside of the room was pitch black, darker even than the hallway. After a moment, my eyes adjusted slightly, and I could see the piano against the back wall. And there was the Musician.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the bench before the instrument sat a tall, thin shadow-figure of a man, only it did not sit facing the piano; it faced me. I could not see if it had eyes, but I could feel its gaze matching mine. I stood paralyzed for a moment, and suddenly realized I was rudely intruding and interrupting the song. I closed the door and began to back away. The song did not resume. I started to hurry back towards the stairs, but I did not make it before I heard the door to the spare room creak open behind me. Stopped in my tracks, I turned around to look. I could not resist. At the end of the hallway, the door had been pushed open only a crack,and from the darkness within was a pair of glowing yellow eyes staring at me. Only a second later the door slammed shut and the music resumed playing. I listened from the top step once again, and for the first time heard the grande finale and end of the music. It was the vast final storm of the sea before the death of the wind and sky and eternal calm over the waters. Alone in the total darkness and complete silence, I retired to bed to sleep, and did not dream that night.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Never again would I hear that beautiful song, though I\u2019ll be damned if I ever forget it.

I learnt about worms in school and I had always been very intrigued by them. They need warm places to live, breathe through their skin, and their colors range from red to brown. I could not tell why adults always refused to tell me about them. It was as if I could not even look at one. I thought, what's wrong with taking a peak? As long as I don't keep it, I don't see the harm.\n\nAt first, I could not tell that I was feeling a little worm. I thought it would be somewhat gooey, but it felt soft and cold, and it perfectly blended with the back of my head, making it really hard to spot. Indeed, I still haven't put my eye on it. I thought, however, that it was normal, and that everyone gets a little worm every once in a while. I saw some on my classmates, teachers, and in my mom, but these seemed to quickly vanish. \n\nMy worm was different, though. It was a little bit like me. It liked the things I liked, and disliked the things I didn't. It would also help me sometimes. For example, if I was too mean to my friends, or I disappointed my parents, it stung me very hard in the back of my head. I liked my little worm. It made me different from the rest, and made me see the world from a much safer and realistic point of view. After a couple of years, I finally let the worm into my head.\n\nOnce inside, my little worm got full access to my thoughts. This was good, I told myself, as every sting was a sign that something needed a little fixing. But time passed, and the stinging got more and more painful. Soon, I wasn't able to produce a single thought that came without a spurt of agony; a single action without a burst of misery. But my worm was right: I was repugnant. I was a revolting, soggy, heinous burden. I infected those around me, brought deep sorrow to every room. I hated my little worm, and yet I was nothing without it.\n\nOne day, almost overnight, I couldn't feel it anymore. My thoughts were free and everything seemed so clear so suddenly. I was scared, but very excited. I had learnt a lot thanks to my little worm, and I owed it who I was. It was a new beginning, of forgiveness, growth, and experimentation. It was still in my head, though. And sometimes, some days, it stung. But it brought with it a feeling of familiarity, trust, and even nostalgia. My little worm was my friend now.\n\nI grew up, and my little worm did too. I could feel its bulkier size, its larger weight. We were gonna be unstoppable. Nonetheless, I found it a bit weird that I couldn't only feel it in the back of my head anymore. I now felt it close to my forehead, in between my temples. I guess it had just been moving around. This was about the time when I started spending way too much time inside my own head. It wasn't that interesting or fun, but it felt more appealing than looking at the outside. Colors were lifeless, sounds were flat, food was insipid. People seemed bland, learning felt pointless, curiosity vanished. \n\nMy little worm doesn't sting anymore. But it now blurs all colors, dampens all music, encases all words. Everywhere I look I see its shadow, every breath I take I feel its tail pulling on my eyes. When standing it numbs my eyelids, but when laying down it dries and hardens them; when speaking it sucks my thoughts; when smiling it clots my cheeks. My head gets heavier every day, making it harder to raise. My arms seem to move by themselves, my legs have grown free from my commands.

As I pass the biggest one, I avoid eye contact and start hollering, filling the crisp air of an absurd, primal music. Soon enough the monkeys got down from the trees and started to walk, as people do, stopping and pretending to talk.

One yelled something as he passed me by, making these intricate movements with his arms, as if I were to understand some abstract body cyclist language. After a few minutes the flock thinned. The last one I saw was a pig on a unicycle, struggling to keep up with even the slowest of the flock. I pushed him down and, ignoring his screeching of panic I laid my judgment upon him, taking its pathetic life, to the blind eye of many witnesses. Cleaning my hands on a nearby bush, I was ecstatic.

The lost journals discuss double-helix DNA, right down to its molecular structure.\n\n\"The explorers are said to have discovered the double helix DNA structure 150 years before Watson and Crick!\"\n\n\"It's not possible!\"\n\nMr. Carlson looks at\u00a0\u00a0Jasmine's quiz, and lo and behold, Jasmine's answer is now correct.\n\nWhen Jasmine gets a quiz question wrong, reality corrects itself such that she gets the question right.\n\nMr. Colson decided to put this to the test, so on tomorrow's Shakespeare quiz, he poses a question that none of his students will know: \"In the play Romeo and Juliet, who is Juliet's cousin?\" The answer is Tybalt, but the students wouldn't know\u00a0that because they haven't read it yet.\n\nEvery student in the class, including Jasmine, failed to answer Tybalt on the quiz, just as he had predicted. Mr. Carlson waits, remembering that the Mount McKinley transformation did not occur until he graded the quizzes. He takes out the quizzes to grade them; he immediately turns to Jasmine's; her answer is, Franklin.\n\nMr. Colson shakes his head, filled with skepticism. How will reality change for this to happen?\n\nHe marks the answer wrong, then takes out his cell phone and waits. Refresh, refresh, and refresh on the news website that he uses. All of a sudden, there it is: \n\n\"Historians have discovered an alternative text to Romeo and Juliet; the only difference they see is that Shakespeare had not yet come up with the name of Tybalt, inserting the more modern Franklin in its place.\"\n\nHe can't believe his eyes; this proved it once and for all, whenever Jasmine puts for an answer on a quiz becomes a reality.\n\nIn tomorrow's quiz, Mr. Colson has asked, \"Who is the richest man in the world?\".\n\nJasmine raised her hand during the quiz and asked, \"We never studied\u00a0this in class?\"\n\n\"That's OK. Just put in Brian Colson, and you'll get it right.\"\n\n\"But you're not the richest man in the world; it's Jeff Bezos?\"\n\n\"OK, this is a bonus question; I won't count it against you as long as you put\u00a0my name.\"\n\nWhen the quizzes are returned, he sees that Jasmine entered his name for that question. As soon as the students had gone to lunch, he got out the quizzes and scored Jasmine's, marking it incorrectly and waiting.\n\nHe stayed up until 12:30 a.m., hoping for something to change, but nothing did. Concerned, his wife came down to the living room where he was waiting on his phone, and he told her about the strange situation with a student in his class.\n\nAfter she looked at him like he was insane, but wanting to go to bed, she pretended to support his crazy idea.\n\n\"What if she needs to believe it for reality to change? You told me she already knew\u00a0you weren't the richest man\u00a0in the world?\"\n\n\"Makes\u00a0sense, so it must be something fresh I taught her. Any ideas?\"\n\n\"The Super Bowl is this Sunday; how about asking who will win?\"\n\n\"You're brilliant!\"\n\nMr. Colson tells his students that the Rams will win the Super Bowl during class. He teaches it like an actual lesson giving bulleted notes and sound reasoning. Despite a few arguments from the boys in the class, the class took his word for it. \n\nOn this question, Jasmine has circled the Rams to win the Super Bowl. When school was out on that Friday afternoon, Mr. Colson went straight down to the casino to place $100 on the Rams to win. He wanted to bet more, but he figured there would be time for that if she could predict the winner.\n\nHe won! On Monday, though, he was called to the principal's office.\n\n\"Can you explain why you chose to teach about sports rather than the curriculum?\"\n\nMr. Colson was startled but was let off the hook when he promised never to do it again.\n\nHe was disappointed he had to toss away his NBA lesson for today, but he decided that perhaps something good could come from this.\n\nHe taught about how the world was at peace. For the first time in human history, he told the students that there was no war and no one was killed in battle.\n\nHe asked the quiz question, \"Is there world peace?\" Jasmine responded with the answer she was taught, yes.\n\nThe major news that night was that everyone had called off all wars. He told his wife, who was completely taken aback.\n\nHis wife was now a true\u00a0believer and wanted to seize\u00a0the opportunity.\n\n\"How about you teach the class that a woman named Marilyn Colson received $10 million dollars she had no idea existed?\"\n\nHe told students the next day\u00a0about a woman named Marilyn Colson, giving them her address and other identifiers, who had received $10 million dollars out of nowhere.\n\nHe asked on the quiz, \"What was the name of the woman who unexpectedly received ten million dollars?\"\n\nTo answer the question, Jasmine gave Mr. Colson's wife's name.\n\nMr. Colson felt a rush of exhilaration as he drove home that afternoon, knowing that this could all come true. He was so engrossed that he failed to notice the truck crossing the median. The truck collided with Mr. Colson's car, and he died immediately.\n\nHer husband's death saddened his wife. The next day she found out he had a life insurance policy that she didn't know about; it was worth $10 million dollars.", "ups": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.91}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "Mr. Smith's Island Adventure", "text": " Mr. Smith awoke on the beach still in his suit. The last thing he remembered was the captain making some kind of announcement, and the masks dropping from the ceiling of the airplane. He sat up rubbing his head and looking around. There was no sign of any plane, or any other survivors except a piece of luggage that was equally as soaked as him. *That\u2019s right* he thought, *I held on to that suitcase for dear life. It must have carried me here.* But where was \u2018here\u2019?\n\n The water was crystal clear and filled with colorful fish. The warm ocean breeze told him that his place had made it at last to the Caribbean, where he was headed on a vacation before the crash. But there were no signs of human activity on the beach, nor any other island on the horizon that he could see. He was utterly stranded. *If only I had some kind of a map. Now that would be something!*\n\n With a huff, Mr. Smith stood and brushed as much sand off his suit as possible, wet though it was. *I\u2019m an American, damn it! There\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t overcome!* Mr. Smith went to open the suitcase which had carried him to safety. As soon as he touched the zipper he paused. *Now who\u2019s property is this? I can\u2019t simply take something that isn\u2019t mine, regardless of how much I may want or need it.* He looked at the luggage tag, but the ink had become smudged and illegible. Without contact information, there was no way he could ask leave of the owner to make use of its contents, it wouldn\u2019t be right to do so. In fact it would be theft.\n\n There was nothing Mr. Smith hated so much as theft. In the course of his thirty-year career trading stocks, he had met hundreds of honest men engaging in honest business. But every so often there would be dirty hippies and communists protesting him and his colleagues from outside on the streets. Always they clamored for the government to tax his hard-earned dollars at ever-increasing rates. It was bad enough as it was, taxes being what they are. \u201cWhat right has a man in Washington to take from me money that I earned through honest, hard work?\u201d Mr. Smith used to ask of his colleagues. \u201cNone at all!\u201d they would reply. \u201cIt\u2019s theft is what it is. The right of a man to his own property is sacred.\u201d He would say. \u201cWell said old boy!\u201d his colleagues would answer.\n\n If he abandoned his principles now, he would be no less of a hypocrite than those dirty commies who say \u201c*You* need to work hard so that *I* can take it easy on the government dime.\u201d Real Americans didn\u2019t abandon their principles when the going got tough. So Mr. Smith put down the suitcase. He could do without it.\n\n Inland Mr. Smith turned and walked. The palm trees swayed in the wind were heavy with coconuts. Water was his first concern, of course. Without it he\u2019d quickly go mad and die. In his suit he began to climb up a nearby palm. He was about halfway up when another realization dawned upon him: *Say now, who owns these here coconut trees?* Mr. Smith let himself fall to the ground and put a hand to his chin thoughtfully. *Hmmm, I\u2019ll look around for someone. Perhaps I\u2019m not alone on this island and the owner of these trees is somewhere to be found*.\n\n Into the palmy forest Mr. Smith ventured. The sun here was causing him to sweat profusely, so he loosened his tie and undid the top button of his shirt. *Now if only I had an air conditioning unit. Now that would be something!* He walked for hours, calling out \u201cHello? Hello? Is anybody there? I\u2019d like to buy some of your coconuts!\u201d The island seemed interminably large. He walked until the sun drooped below the horizon and night set in. The trees all around him sagged low with bunches upon bunches of coconuts. They looked so refreshing. *I don\u2019t need to steal to make my way in life. Never have, never will. The American Spirit will sustain me!*\n\n Mr. Smith dug himself a shallow hole in the sand and settled in for the night. It was time to rest. Just as he was getting ready to drift off to sleep, there was a thud behind him. He turned over and saw that a coconut had fallen from a tree. There was already a crack showing in its husk. *It would be awfully simple to give it a good whack on some rock and have a fresh drink*.*..if only the damn thing had landed on my head. Then, perhaps, I\u2019d have a good lawsuit on my hands. There\u2019d be no end to the coconuts I could receive in a settlement of some kind*. Somewhat shamefully, Mr. Smith placed his head beneath the palm tree and went to sleep.\n\n When he woke once more, the sun was already hot and high. Mr. Smith\u2019s lips were cracked and he was getting to feel lightheaded. *That\u2019s nothing to stop an American. No sir.* Untouched by falling coconuts, he rose to his feet and prepared himself to find the owner of these trees \u2013 and soon. Once again Mr. Smith walked around, looking for someone who could point him in the right direction. He lost track of how many hours he walked.\n\n Eventually Mr. Smith fell to his knees before some fallen coconuts. He hadn\u2019t the strength to continue. *Perhaps\u2026I can...pay the fellow back...later.* Mr. Smith, willing to make this one concession, reached for one of the coconuts in front of him.\n\n *Bang!* An explosion rang out among the trees. Mr. Smith stopped his hand\u2019s movement just as it brushed against the beckoning husk. Then he felt his gut. Oh, it was horrible, far more horrible than any other pain he\u2019d experienced. Mr. Smith let out an agonized groan and fell over to the side.\n\n Suddenly before him was a tall man in a precocious white suit with a blue shirt and red tie. His white hair and beard were scraggly, but appointed well around his gently wrinkled face. The man in the white suit was holding a beautiful AR-15 with an American flag draped from it. The barrel was still smoking. Mr. Smith wondered how he didn\u2019t see the man before, or how he missed the very clear metal sign posted on one of the trees. It read: **PRIVATE PROPERTY \u2013 ALL TRESPASSERS WILL BE SHOT ON SIGHT**\n\n \u201cThis here is private property.\u201d the man said. He tapped the sign with the barrel of his rifle. \u201cCan\u2019t you read?\u201d\n\n Through wheezing breaths and bloody coughs, Mr. Smith responded, \u201cI apologize...sir...It wasn\u2019t...my intention\u2026to trespass\u2026I had\u2026nowhere...else to...go.\u201d\n\n  \u201cAnd how is that my problem? How does that give *you* the right to make use of *my* property? That\u2019s no different than theft? Are you a thief, sir?\u201d\n\n \u201cNo sir. I\u2019m no thief. I\u2019m an honest, God-fearing, hard-working American. I just fell on some hard luck is all.\u201d\n\n \u201cReally? Because to me you look like a no-good commie hippie squatter, sleeping on land that doesn\u2019t belong to you. You should be ashamed of yourself. I\u2019ll give you one chance to go on and get out of here, or else you will face your end here by the hand of Mr. Ayn Rand Paul Ryan, Founder CEO of Petit St. Jacques Island LLC.\u201d\n\n \u201cI thank you for your kindness, Mr. Ryan. Only give me a minute to pull myself up.\u201d Mr. Smith was struck by the charity of Mr. Ryan and was grateful for his understanding. With all his remaining strength, he pushed himself back up to his knees. When he tried to get to his feet, his wound gushed blood. He doubled over. Mr. Ryan began a countdown. \u201cFive...four...three...\u201d Mr. Smith put pressure on the wound and tried again, but he couldn\u2019t get any further. \u201c....two...one...\u201d *Now if only I had some bootstraps.

For years I've seen her sitting on that bench, as I make my way to work, crossing this park.  \n\nIt's funny, we've never actually greeted each others, let alone speak, but I have this feeling that we both notice each others. \n\n \n\nOne cold morning I poured my coffee down the drain and made my way outside, to be greeted by a morning mist, a sort of shapeless guardian of time, fighting the sun to keep this peculiar moment, called crepuscule, going.  \n\nWell, I felt minuscule, as I walked across the road, these dark fluffy clouds hovering over the very city I've lived in all my life. I made small talk with the chicken, on the other side of the road, exchanging pleasantries.  \n\nME \t\t''How are the kids''  \n\nCHICKEN \t''They're just fine, still in their eggs and all''  \n\nME \t\t''Well, say hello to the wife will ya friend''  \n\nCHICKEN\t        \u201cWill not, since a fox got to her last week, gruesome affair''  \n\nME \t\t''Sad to hear it, good day''  \n\nCHICKEN     \t''Same to you, watch for the geese''  \n\nAs I tucked my icicles in my pockets, I realised that I was laughing like a mad person, completely lost in my mind, walking. Making my way under the tall trees, I entered the park. In these trees were big-nosed monkeys, hurling rocks and branches at passerby. As I pass the biggest one, I avoid eye contact and start hollering, filling the crisp air of an absurd, primal music. Soon enough the monkeys got down from the trees and started to walk, as people do, stopping and pretending to talk. The big-nosed one stayed on his branch and clapped his hands, then I kissed his ring. Blessed by his majesty the Prime minister of the big tree, I kept on walking my merry way.  \n\nMy mind kept trying to focus on the upcoming day at work, but such thoughts could wait a few more minutes. As I turned to the left at a park highway, a flock of cyclists passed me on the left, at incredible speed. All of them had the standard Spandex suit, with the helmet and sunglasses. One yelled something as he passed me by, making these intricate movements with his arms, as if I were to understand some bodily cyclist language. After a few minutes the flock thinned. The last one I saw was a pig on a unicycle, struggling to keep up with even the slowest of the flock. I pushed him down and, ignoring his screeching of panic I laid my judgment upon him, taking its pathetic life, to the blind eye of many witnesses. Cleaning my hands on a nearby bush, I was ecstatic. My white tie was stained with the invisible blood of a non-existent animal that I slain without pity, yet my mind was in complete ebullition.  \n\nAbove me was hovering one of the biggest dragonfly I'd ever seen, and I've seen at least two in my twenty-four years on this earth. In one swift move its wing began flapping in a noisy way, and it stood still, a few meters above the ground. Its wings were so noisy in fact that I couldn't hear anything else, neither the chirping of the harpies nor the screams of agony of the ants. The dragonfly flew away, seemingly disinterested by my humble presence. The deafening silence made way to a symphony of nature's most mundane noises. Only to be interrupted by a soloist, performing the lacrimosia.  \n\nI had completely forgot her.  \n\nThere she was, again.

His demeanor had changed from confusion to sadness, for the torn, faded picture was held for a long time.\n\r\n  \u201cWho is that? Is that all? What do you mean by cake? How are you a cake? What do you\u2026? Do you\u2026? What\u2026?\u201d My questions became a wave, and in almost any ocean, seemed to be lost in the greatness of it all. The man held the photo for a long, long time; he seemed to want to hold it until it could be real. After some more time in his mind, the poor old soul put away the photograph and preached once more.\n\r\n  \u201cYou know that cake is rare? I remember that there used to be no cake. Some people never got cake, and some people got too much cake. I had cake once; it was lovely until the rain came. I am sure that you have had cake too, I am sure it was perfect. I wish that I never had cake, I wish that all the rain would come early. I wish that all the cake was in the rain.\u201d\r\n\r\n  His old, grey, tired demons held seas now. I had stopped pacing and held my full attention to him. I wanted to ask more questions, and keep asking until my time was out, but I knew that there was only one question that mattered.\n\r\n  \u201cWhat is cake?\u201d I asked quizzically.\n\r\n  The man wiped his waterfalls, and spoke in a much quieter voice than before, for the rain had broken his mind, and his words.\n\r\n  \u201cI am a cake. She was a cake. You are a cake. I once drank a cake that had more years than me, and I had rain for many days. My cake was once in the rain, and now I have no cake. I am sure that if she were here, I would not be a cake, and I would be happy. I am sure that if she had as much cake as me, she would know what the rain does to it. You will have more cake than me I\u2019m sure, as will everyone that does not find the perfect cake. I wish that I had more cake, and I wish that there was no rain, did you know that rain only comes where cake is?\u201d\n\r\n  My mind was now running faster than ever, faster than any tiger, athlete, and lie. I thought of all my cake, and how much cake I want to have. I thought of all the rain that would soon pounce, and how much of that cake would be worth the rain. We sat in the train station for a long time, and we thought for a long time. I thought about nothing and everything, as did the man. I wanted to ask everything, and I needed to ask everything, for one does not leave with just the thought of cake in the rain. I thought about how the world was almost dark if you stared long enough, and how the word \u201cbowl\u201d is a rather funny one if you say it enough. Eventually, after my decade long trance had rid my mind of any sense, my train had arrived.\n\r\n  I wiped the sudden rain on my cheeks, stared at the man, and contemplated what to say. Although regretfully, I decided that nothing was best. I boarded my train with an empty plate and clear skies, for I had no cake, and therefore I had no rain. The window of the dark transit lay frozen in time, and as it pulled away from the station, the man looked up. With complexion lost in frosted panes, and cake left in the rain, I thought of where he would go, who he would be, and if he even knew I existed. Although I suppose that doesn\u2019t matter, as he does not speak for my truth, as I most certainly do not speak of cake in the rain.", "ups": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "Hopium", "text": "It started as a gimmick, a quick fix for a depressed generation hooked on television, social media, low vitamin d levels and zero socialising skills.

Enjoy, and thank you for reading!)\n\nThere was not a benevolent god. Though the breezes that blew through the land were simply divine and the grasses were lush and greener than emeralds, Faith knew from the moment she awoke there that this was not the Heaven of which she had dreamed. This was something else, a predator's paradise, and she was the prey. \n\nThe other unfortunate souls who had ended up there were few and far between, at least as far as Faith had seen. She had only been there for a week at most- time was strange in that place, so it was hard to tell, but her first few days had been spent in tears, wondering how it had come to this. She had been a good Christian girl who lost her battle with a terrible disease. Her very name was a testament to the strength of her beliefs. She followed the Commandments and went to church every Sunday, but the Heaven she was promised did not exist. This place was beautiful to be sure, although the grey of the empty sky left much to be desired, but there was no jubilation here, nor everlasting love. \n\nAnd how grateful she was that the skies were empty. At least for now, no solitary silhouette of wings shadowed the ground. No angels flew overhead, searching for nourishment in the hapless souls that knew no better. \n\nShe peered out from the makeshift shelter she had constructed out of branches and leaves. The forest nearby was too dangerous to enter, but its scraps were her sanctuary, bits and pieces she had scavenged from the outskirts. The verdant grasses that grew so long and luscious coated the top, disguising it from the aerial hunters who dominated this place.\n\nThe angels nested in the forest. She knew from a too-close experience in which she had only been saved by a soul who saw her wandering alone, too new to understand the dangers of this hellish paradise. She caught a glimpse of one then. Wings dripping in silver, eyes within eyes, and wheels within wheels. It surpassed understanding, and she had been unable to look away from its hypnotic gaze until the kindly soul had spotted her and dragged her from the edge of the forest. \n\nNow, as she crouched in her hideaway, she wondered why she must live this way. In her mortal life, earthly delights had passed her by constantly. She denied temptation again and again, and this was where that discipline had brought her? It was unjust, to say the least. \n\nA shadow fell across the ground outside, skimming over the grass. Faith held her breath, though she had no need to breathe any longer. It was habit, nothing more. More daring than she had ever been in life, she peeked out towards the sky. The angel moved fast, its wings slanted at a harsh angle. It was hunting. \n\nSure enough, she saw its prey moments later. It was a young boy, even younger than Faith. He stumbled through the grass towards the forest. Faith\u2019s heart lurched as the angel swooped down. She looked away, watching from the corner of her eye, lest she become entranced once more. Silver tendrils erupted from the angel\u2019s impossible form, curling around the boy. He cried out in terror, but that sound was the last he could make, for the tendrils sought his open mouth, filling it and choking off his cries. \n\nFaith could watch no more. She closed her eyes, hot tears seeping down her cheeks. There was nothing she could have done. She knew that. And yet, something in her awoke. Something fierce and intense. This was *her* paradise, not theirs. Angels were servants of God. That was what she had been taught. \n\nOnce she was sure the angel had disappeared, she left her shelter. Her body shook with fright, but she forced herself to move towards the forest. She took long, deliberate strides, passing shelters belonging to other souls. She felt their eyes upon her and she called out to them. \u201cWe must fight!\u201d she said. \u201cI will not live in fear any longer. Rise up and join me against this terror!\u201d \n\nNo one moved. An old man raised a trembling finger and pointed as a shadow fell across her body. She stiffened and spun around. The golden irises of eyes within eyes were so close now, so beautiful. Silver tendrils slid out, reaching for her. She almost let them. But the image of the little boy came to her, and she clenched her fists before snatching for the tendrils. They were slick in her hands, but her grip did not falter. She pulled. \n\nThe angel screamed. Never before had Faith heard such a sound, and she fell backwards, out of its reach. She landed in the soft grass, and the angel loomed over her. But Faith was not about to give up. She leapt to her feet and caught hold of the tendrils once more, tugging with all her might. The angel\u2019s scream echoed across the hills, and Faith felt something pouring from her ears. Blood, if she had to guess. It mattered not. \n\nA thick tendril lashed out, flinging her away, and she grinned even as she hit the ground hard. She had hurt it. She was on her feet in seconds, and this time, a second pair of hands joined hers as she wrenched at the tendrils. The old man was not so feeble as he appeared, and he ripped a tendril from the angel. Silvery essence drifted from the wound. The angel\u2019s screams intensified. \n\nAnother woman appeared beside Faith, then two more, and a man. Soon, the bedraggled, frightened souls surrounded the angel. They slashed at its eyes with branches, small stones, and even their fingernails. Tendrils were flying overhead, disconnected from the body of the angel. Gleaming feathers were torn from its wings. It could not stand against the souls\u2019 assault, and at last, it toppled, staining the grass with its silver blood.  \n\nFaith stood in the center of the souls. They all looked to her with wide eyes. Never before had there been a victory against these hunters. Never before had hope filled their hearts while in this place. Faith took a deep breath and raised her fist in the air. \u201cWe will take back Paradise!\u201d she cried. \u201cTogether, we are strong! Together, we will prevail!\u201d \n\nThe souls cheered. A woman with a low, quavery voice began to sing. Faith didn\u2019t recognize the song, but others joined in, and she found herself singing too. The words were easy to remember. It was a song of triumph, a song of victory. \n\nShadows fell upon them, and Faith looked skyward to see angels circling overhead. The battle was just beginning, but they would win. They had to. \n\n\\-Autumn Isobel Smith\n\nwww.autumnisobelsmith.com", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.76}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "Zenith: Part I", "text": "Link to the prologue - [https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/tp0q0c/sf\\_zenith\\_prolog/](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/tp0q0c/sf_zenith_prolog/)\n\nLink to Part II - [https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/ttd3vw/sf\\_zenith\\_part\\_ii/](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/ttd3vw/sf_zenith_part_ii/) \n\nShe sat stunned, looking at the readout on the monitor. She was not willing to, unable to accept the implication of the data. But Cassandra Alexander had rechecked her findings three times. She had read the notes. She had done the calculations. There could be no mistaking. \"This explains the failure at the particle accelerator lab,\" she thought to herself. \"And at the *Lovell Museum*. And, dear God, the *Sea of Tranquility Observation Dome*.\"\n\nBut why? Professor Faith Carr was one of the most respected researchers not just at *Zenith*, but probably on the entire moon. Was she capable of going to such lengths to cover her tracks? Did she really hate Nick that much? \"*Why*?\"\n\nShe opened another document on the data chip and read. \"'*Hestia-3*.' She actually gave the damn thing a name,\" she whispered to herself. Cassie thought the name sounded like something from Greek mythology. She did a quick search on her PDA. *Hestia* as it turned out was the Greek Goddess of hearth and domestic life. How sickly ironic, she thought. Hestia-3 works at the molecular level. It slowly weakened a standard, five-inch thick haloplex window or container over 5 to 10 hours. Then, sudden failure. \"This could be an assassin's wet dream for God's sake,\" she said aloud.\n\nThe entire base had been on edge after the S.O.T.O. Dome failure. Everyone believed there was a logical explanation.  Sure, there was loose talk about sabotage or a serial killer. However, such ideas were relegated to some obscure forums on the base network. The very idea of an off world serial killer, a first, was too farfetched to take seriously.\n\nBut a jealous wife? \"Why not?\" Cassie asked herself as she mulled over the idea. Professor Carr has been intimating for months that she thought Nick was having an affair hasn't she? Cassie recalled dinner at the Carr's the month before. It had started out pleasant. The Carr's had very nice quarters. They were cavernous compared to her three-room hovel. It was one of the benefits of being a highly regarded, senior researcher. Cassie always appreciated being invited there.\n\nThings were fine until Faith made that remark about the \"leggy brunet\" she thought she saw leaving their quarters earlier in the day.\n\nNick seemed amused and took it for a joke. \"Not *her* again\" he had said with a chuckle. He gave the impression this was not the first time the subject had come up.\n\nProfessor Carr however showed genuine irritation at his dismissive attitude.\n\nFor her part, Cassie had let the uncomfortable moment pass and immediately tried to forget about it. However, even if Faith was right. Even if Nick had become a lecherous, cheating, scumbag, she didn't have the right to kill him and his mistress. Nor the ten people who were victims of her \"field tests.\" Under different circumstances, Carr's research and creation would easily have won her a Nobel at the least. She had meticulously documented her research like she was going to make a grant proposal. This brilliant woman had found a unique way to improve haloplex. Then, she turned it into a tool for murder.\n\nSafety protocols at *Zenith* and nearby bases had been strengthened since the decompression at *Tranquility* that cost those seven lives. Consensus seemed to be building that a flawed lot of haloplex windows had been produced and installed around *Zenith*. With the recently completed base expansion and renovations, it seemed plausible.\n\nBase authorities were assuring the populous that if true, any other windows or containers could be identified via serial numbers and replaced. Haloplex production was tightly monitored and controlled. Everyone knew that. Moreover, the fact two of the three failures had been at interior locations kept people from walking around in vac suits. The death of three people in lab accidents, while tragic did not hold the same terror as death in vacuum.\n\nNow, as she sat there alone in the Structural Analysis Lab, Cassie could not see an easy way forward. She could not just make a wild accusation. Carr was head of a major department. She was good friends with several of the base senior administrative staff. And she was her mentor.

This came following several world war scares that would have resulted in the destruction of the entire planet. In the year 2046, the United States, Russia, China, UK and France all send members from their countries to begin the colonization of Mars, this comes after almost a decade of preparing the planet for colonization. After several decades of unforeseen advancements in technology, no doubt due to the never before seen world wide cooperation, Earth makes its first space craft capable of battle in space. Dreadnoughts, cruisers, battleships, all each with their unique purpose begin being developed, as if Earth knew there was a foe out there that would threaten them at some point.\n\nThe year is 2112, after almost 60 years of colonization, the planet of Mars is being terraformed. The native colonists of Mars declare their independence from Earth and establish themselves as the first independent human nation not from Earth.\n\n2118 - After over 100 years of sending signals into deep space in hopes of hearing a response from an alien species, the people of Earth hear back from a group of alien specie's who call themselves the Agel Empire. They briefly share some information about each other and their history, before the Agel write them off as too weak to join them, claiming the human race is too weak and not advanced enough to serve our cause. Fueled by blunt comments the people of Earth and Mars go into another state of extreme technological advancement. Their advancement, as well as the booming population of the human race on Earth, causes Earth to seek out other countries for resources. One of the best candidates is a planet called Thesulia, a baren planet, but rich in resources. After many years of testing, Earth sends research drones to investigate the planet. Their suspicions about the planet being rich in resources they need are confirmed, but they find out that the planet is actually suitable for life. Although not an ideal place for colonization, Earth determines that the planet is more suitable than Mars was during the early stages of its colonization phase.\n\n2134 - The planet of Thesulia has been successfully colonized and has been flourishing. The capital of Thesulia, Minona, flourishes as the mining industry brings in millions upon millions of revenue to the city.\n\nA few decades go by, the year is now 2152, A distress beacon gets activated from Minona, the capital of Thesulia. The military of earth dispatches a cruiser and two battleships as a response team to respond to the distress beacon. They do not think much of the distress beacon, Afterall there wasn't much information relayed to them back on Earth. Earth sends the small fleet, under the command of a young up and coming captain, Audie Lancaster. Captain Audie Lancaster is one of the youngest and brightest Captains in Earth's Navy. Having just been promoted to the position of Captain, this mission will serve as his first true test of his abilities as a leader, his first mission as captain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you guys like this I will make this a regular thing, please keep in mind this is the Intro I haven't really done much with this yet, I am just seeing how this will do and will go from there.

It made Staci feel happy that she was not involved with anyone, except Benny. Suddenly she saw the man grab the woman, a large knife was in his hand.

Did you know that? When they witnessed my power before recorded history began. When they saw that I did not experience the pull of gravity. When they saw that there was no limit to my strength or my speed. Have you heard the Epic of Gilgamesh? The Legends of Heracles, or Achilles, or Beowulf? They're all true, you know? To some extent, anyway. They're all about one man though, not many. Well, not a man, man, obviously. You know what? I'll start at the beginning, hm?\n\n\nThe earliest thing I can remember is a bright light and a terrible roar. Like thunder, but everywhere and nowhere all at once, then I was here, on Earth. It wasn't called Earth at the time. In fact I don't believe it had a name at all, and neither did I. I was shapeless. Aimless. I spent centuries wandering around looking for purpose. For some meaning to my inexplicable existence. Finally, I found it when I first laid eyes upon you. I fell in love.\u00a0\n\nHumanity was my purpose, I realized, and soon, I had shaped myself in your image. That's right. I wanted nothing more than to fit in with you. Live alongside you. Be one of you. I created from nothing a body for myself that fit all the ideals of your race. I was tall and strong and beautiful. Then, I stood back and I watched, and waited for the perfect moment to reveal myself to you. In the meantime, I worked hard to protect you. To help you build. All the while, keeping my true identity hidden from you. My deeds became stories. The stories became legends, and the legends became myths.\u00a0\n\nMy moment finally came to do something great, to prove my love to you, when the Atlanteans struck your cities from the sea. I reacted too slowly to stop their onslaught but the blow I dealt was decisive. Final. Your bronze age civilization was pushed to the brink of collapse but I fought your assailants to the very edge of extinction. I wiped their cities from existence and crushed their very memory beneath my heel in your name.\u00a0\n\nWhen the dust had settled I revealed myself to you as your savior... and you quailed. I could see the fear in your eyes as I soared, triumphant, over your cities. I could feel your hate despite my act of unadulterated love for you. Some saw my kindness, the purity of my motives, but the rest\u2026 the rest saw only a new threat in me. They hunted me. Tried to murder and torture their very savior. The one who had saved them from servitude and slavery.\n\nI let them do what they would. Let them crucify me and humiliate me. Let them think that their enemy was gone. Then I rose from where they had left me, unhurt, save for my pride. I repaired my body and returned to the shadows. After that, my existence became one of impatience and boredom. I amused myself by fighting in your wars, and laughed as you recorded the epic deeds of my false identities in your histories and myths. Centuries passed and you continued to grow. To advance. To master nature and the world around you. My desire to stand at your side began to resurge, until I stood in the light once more ready to announce myself to you. To make myself known. The opportunity came once again to prove myself worthy of your devotion when Mars launched an attack against your pristine world.\n\nSome of you decided to call me Alpha-Man after witnessing my strength against your extraplanetary foes. An amusing pseudonym, to be sure. Seeing the adoration in your eyes is all I needed, however. All I ever wanted in my long and storied existence. Finally, I felt\u2026 complete. Finally I felt worthwhile. Loved.\n\nAs with all great things, though, pretenders soon began to emerge. 'Superheroes' they called themselves, and lumped me in among themselves. Pathetic. Weak. Imposters. That is all they were. And so I began my work of ridding you of the infestation. You, my love. My purpose. You had me, and that is all you needed. The others would only betray, hurt, and disappoint you.\n\nThe Blink was the first to feel the bite of my blade. He was said to be the fastest man alive. Second to none. Second only to me. Next were the Amazons. An entertaining battle, but in the end, they were only ten, and I was indomitable. Third was the Made Man. A simple human man, in reality, hiding behind technology and wealth. After that, the list quickly shrank as I worked my way around the globe. There was the Firebug, a pyromancer operating in Europe, whose neck was easier to snap than a charred twig. Iceage, a frost-powered lunatic living in Egypt who would have lost control of his powers and plunged your world into chaos, had I not stopped him first. The Panther. Ah, the Panther. She had quite a fight in her. Strong, fast, clever, but ultimately, as dead as the rest.\u00a0\n\nEventually a council was gathered of the remaining, so-called 'heros'. Conveniently, I, your Alpha-Man, was invited to attend alongside the others. They voted to put Corona in charge. What a joke, Corona. This was it though, this was the moment to strike one final blow and end the corruption once and for all. And so I did. Aboard the orbital station built to house the new League of Heros, I struck my final blow. All of them. Every. Last. One... was left as little more than a red smear across the metal floor of the council chamber.\n\nAnd that brings us to today, does it not? Look at me, please, and stop crying.

He sits in the light for a moment. A smile crosses his face, but we see it is forced and fleeting. A corpse of a smile.\n\nThe house has several frames bathing small sections of the room in precious warm light.\n\nThe earth beneath the house shakes seemingly in frustration, and on the far wall to the left, a delicate frame is disturbed and falls.

The contents, a memory, a droplet of happiness, lofts up like the amber bubbles in a beer glass.\n\nThe weird man grabs at it, catching it, just before it moves out of arm's reach, he pulls it down forcefully and squishes in his arms, and in its reflection, we can see *A pot bubbling on the fire stove, two weird little hands are precisely stirring its contents, the viewpoint turns, and his small daughter is cutting vegetables gleefully.

The weird man is taken with the upward momentum, up, up, he holds on to it, stroking it, sorrow painfully chiseled on his weird little face. And yet the droplet slips through undaunted, like slick ice in a tight grip\u2026. Wafting up and up. he reaches desperate as he descends, but it slips away. And as the beautiful bubble hits the ceiling, it bursts, expelling the light within, like a silent firework.\n\nHe lands with a crumpled thud where the memory had previously lit the floor, and all the frames in the house jitter.

I can hear the gentle rumble of their tanks in the distance, I can smell the fumes of the exhaust. Through the gloom and haze of the early morning, I can see them in the distance approaching the edge of the village. I never would have been able to do this before I was turned.\n\nI don\u2019t remember who I was before I was turned or why, all that matters now is that the Sound told me and my brothers to be here and to wait.\n\nThey have no idea we are here, my brothers lurk nearby, waiting. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they are walking into a trap. We are that trap.\n\nFrom atop a building overlooking the narrow streets below, I let out a low growl to inform my brothers to make ready, they reply in kind and I hear them begin to edge closer to the roadside. I hear my brother's hearts begin to beat faster in preparation, another growl tells them to calm themselves, that the time isn\u2019t right, that we must wait.\n\nI can see them more clearly now, there were nearly 50 of them, a number of tanks and other vehicles, slowly advancing towards us, checking each building. Were they looking for us, or something else? It must be something else, no way they could know we were here. One smell cuts through the smell of the exhaust from the tanks, I can smell their fear, I can hear their racing pulses, they are all scared, they had good reason to be.\n\nI hear their voices now, it's not a language that I was familiar with, but I remember some of the words, I remember hearing them before I was turned.\n\n\u201cBuildings all clear Captain!\u201d said one.\n\n\u201cWhere the fuck are these Krauts?\u201d replied another.\n\nOne of the men was looking at a map by torchlight, gesturing to other nearby buildings, instructing the men where to go. His heart was steady, with no smell of fear. He was in charge, he was my prey\n\nI can feel my brothers becoming impatient, I sympathise with them, why are we still waiting, they were right there, ripe for slaughter. Yet the Sound hadn't told us to attack, it kept us waiting. The tiles began to crack under my claws as my muscle tensed, my anticipation becoming unbearable. They were directly below us now, the men following the tank as it entered the narrow street out of the town. We had to go now or we would miss our chance, now was the time.\n\nThe moment finally came. The Sound pinged, at last, my fur bristled as it passed through me. With a thunderous howl, I signaled to my brothers to attack, to unleash their fury on these invaders, and unleash it they did.\n\n\u201cWolves!\u201d roared one of the men below, panic rippled through the rest of them as they scrambled for cover and protection, trying to find us in the gloom with torches and searchlights. They were too late, we had sprung our trap.\n\nI pounced off of my rooftop, landing on top of the lead tank directly below me. As I looked up, I was staring directly into the face of a terrified crewman, I snarled at him as he tried to turn his weapon on me.  \n\nOne swipe of my claw was enough to nearly remove his head from his shoulders. Blood erupted from the wound as his body fell back into the tank. The smell of iron filled my nose, awakening something inside of me, I searched around for who would be next.  \n\nBefore I could pounce on my next victim the Sound pinged again. This time a deeper tone, I remembered what I must do. I reached for the pouch hanging from my belt, tore off the cord, and pushed it through the open hatch, past the corpse of the crewman deep into the belly of the tank. As I let go, I could hear panicked voices from inside the metal shell, I leapt from the tank through the window of a nearby house.  \n\nA deep explosion erupted from the tank, launching the turret into the air, narrowly missing a group of men as it landed. Our surprise was beginning to fade now, a cacophony of gunfire began, the smell of gunpowder filling the air, drowning out all other smells, as the men began to try to defend themselves. What little good it would do.\n\nA second explosion roared from down the street, back towards the square. They were trapped now. Now it was just a matter of time before they would all be dead.\n\nAs I lumbered back through the shattered window, letting out another deafening howl, and looked for my next victim, it didn\u2019t take long. As I tore out throats with my fangs and disemboweled with my claws, I could hear the snarls and roars of my brothers doing the same, and slowly but surely the gunfire became less and less.  \n\nI was drenched with blood and viscera by the time I heard a different sound, a yelp, and a whimper. One of my brothers had been injured, how badly I couldn\u2019t know, that would have to wait, I had to hunt.\n\nAs the last of the gunfire ceased and the smell of gunpowder faded, the air was thick with the smell of iron and that of those soldiers who had soiled themselves as they died, I searched for one smell, one smell that had stood out.\n\nThe one man who didn\u2019t smell of fear, even now nothing but calm, he was who we were after. He was why all these men had to die. He was who the Sound wanted.  \n\nMy brothers and I regrouped as the slaughter finished. My wounded brother limped over, he would survive, the injury was minor. We found the man without fear taking shelter in one of the houses lining the street. He heard us sniffing and padding up the stairs shouting at us as we closed in.\n\n\u201cYou stay away from me you fuckers, I\u2019ll send you straight back to hell!\u201d firing a few shots from his weapon through the closed door as we approached.  \n\nOne inaudible growl was enough to tell one of my brothers to retrieve him unharmed, just as the Sound wanted. We tore the door from its hinges and before the man could react his cries were cut short as he was dragged back on the street my brother grasping him by the throat, he still struggled and flailed at my brother, he had no hope of escape now.\n\nOur ears all pricked as we heard it, a door being bashed open and frantic footsteps fading away somewhere down the street.

I had narrowly survived the first year after the minotaur stampede that the Dark Mage Halloran unleashed. Gods only know why he is after Johan. He isn\u2019t that good a mage, to begin with. Always seems to be up to some kind of mischief.\n\nI make my way down the hallway and pass Johan and his friends. They are speaking in whispers. Clearly, they think Haloran is going to return this year. I really hope he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m here for a simple course to research and get my degree in herbology with a minor in Artificing. I do not need mad mages ruining my experiments and burning the dorm where my thesis is kept.\n\nIt is by the Gods mercy I used flame magic proof paper and ink. Giving a friendly wave to a pair of first-years who are gaping around the building. Oh, how I miss those days. So naive. So clueless to the hell they are about to step into. \n\nI finally reach my goal of the Professor's meeting room. I, along with a few other exemplary students, have been called for a meeting. Stepping into the room, I can see every professor lined up. There is even Lord Sloth, for once not in his research building. This must be an important meeting if he is here.\n\n\u201cThank you, Alan, for joining us\u201d, Professor Alex says, gesturing for me to stand alongside five other students standing stock still. \n\n\u201cSir, why have we been called here?\u201d Alora asks, flicking her hair in the haughty way she usually does. \n\n\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d Lord Sloth begins before trailing off. \n\n\u201cBefore we begin, we will need you to sign a blood contract that what we tell you will not leave your lips after you walk out this room\u201d, Professor Yuu says, rolling out a parchment covered in ancient runes. \n\n\u201cA blood contract?\u201d I exclaim. Using such a thing on students means this is beyond anything a normal mage will be handling. Hesitantly I sign along the bottom along with each of the other students. Finally, we each prick our finger and allow a single drop of blood to fall on the page. The blood is absorbed and vanishes.\n\n\u201cGood with that; we can continue,\u201d Lord Sloth says with a smile. \n\n\u201cWe wish for you boys and girls and quex to become School Prefects\u201d, Sloth explains.\n\n\u201cWhy the shecreshy shir?\u201d Quexly asks, their tongue flickering.\n\n\u201cSimple, while you\u2019ll have your normal duties, you will have additional ones on top of what your fellows will do\u201d, Sloth explains, resting his elbows on the table and steepling his fingers. \n\n\u201cWhat would that be, sir?\u201d I ask. \n\n\u201cSimple, you are aware of Johan, I take it?\u201d Sloth asks. The group of students all nod.\n\n\u201cPerfect, your first task will be to harass him and his group of friends at every single turn. Every minor infraction you see must be punished with the maximum sentence\u201d, Sloth explained.\n\nI and the others all had perplexed looks. While it would be enjoyable to exact some revenge on Johan, this seems unbelievably petty. \n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Alora asks, dropping her haughty act.\n\n\u201cSimple, you will be \u2018Under the Control\u2019 of good sir Halloran\u201d, Sloth explains, gesturing to a door that was opened. In stepped the Dark Mage Halloran, who gave a sheepish wave. \n\nI and the others instantly readied our wands and equipment. Prepared to fight this mad mage. Had he taken control of the teachers? This really was a worst-case scenario. A loud finger snap echoed from behind us, and I could feel my mana being suppressed by an overbearing level of mana. Turning around, I saw Professor Alex wag his finger at us. Before pointing back to sloth.\n\n\u201cYou see, you lot are the most exceptional students of the second years.

These brats who think they are the best are going to leave school realising they peaked and fall to the obscurity they so rightly deserve\u201d, Sloth said with venom dripping from his voice.\n\n\u201cI am aware how this will sound coming from me. But we do not like nor tolerate slothful students\u201d, Sloth said sardonically.\n\nI, along with the others, was stunned and confused.\n\n\u201cBut yoush are meant to teash shtudentsh\u201d, Quexly shouted.\n\n\u201cAnd we do, but some students will never learn. We identify them in the first month and set loose a Dark Mage on them\u201d, Professor Yuu explained. \n\n\u201cBut this is disruptive to other students\u201d, Alora protested. \n\n\u201cIs it though? Our attacking mages never harm other students. They ensure no work is destroyed. Professors even make sure any experiments that may be ruined are protected\u201d, Professor Alex explained. \n\n\u201cIf anything, many students feel motivated to improve all the more to stand above this outside threat\u201d, Grund, the combat teacher, added finally speaking up. \n\n\u201cIndeed, we see an upswing in grades whilst doing these things\u201d, Sloth nodded.\n\n\u201cSo we are to be Halloran\u2019s cronies as it were?\u201d I asked. Halloran nodded.\n\n\u201cBully them, punish them at every turn. Make their lives as difficult as possible if you are ever confronted, act ignorant. Worse case, they follow you, and we can pretend you were mind-controlled. Works every time\u201d, Halloran said. \n\nSo much for a quiet year was all I could think as I accepted the prefect's badge.

You can't unplug its neural network and expect it to function, it'll go entropic.\"\n\nYang looked at the monitor then mumbled, \"That's weird.\"\n\n\"What?\" Donavon asked.\n\n\"There's a message.\"\n\" from?\"\n\"GTPR500,\" Yang turned to Donavan, \"but it doesn't contain any answer.\"\n\nDonavan rose from his chair wanting to read the message, but it wasn't in any language known to humanity, \"What's this?\"\n\n\"A message of some sort,\" Yang replied.\n\"Encrypted?\" Asked Donavan.\n\"No.\"\n\"Translation?\"\n\"No response, the machine is still running.\"\n\nGTPR500 was determined a roadblock, and the senior researcher decided to restart the project with an updated version.

It didn\u2019t harm anyone, the robots were hacked yet intended no harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d Dimitri interrupted.\n\n\u201cExactly, they weren\u2019t attacking, they were protecting,\u201d Donavan replied.\n\n\u201cProtecting?\u201d Asked Dimitri.\n\u201cYes. We figured since it intended no harm,\u201d continued Donavan, \u201cthe third law of robotics, to follow human commands, wasn\u2019t broken. The machine simply prioritized the first two laws.\u201d\n\nDimitri asked with palpable confusion, \u201cTo not harm humans and to preserve one\u2019s self. Was it protecting itself?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought at first,\u201d replied Donavan, \u201cbut then I went over the latest diagnostic reports. At this rate, the neural weights won\u2019t function for long. It\u2019s destroying itself. Ladies and gentlemen, this is where things get disturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Dimitri asked.\n\u201cThe diagnostic reports also show a new quantum linkage between GTPR500 and an autonomous mining facility around Jupiter,\u201d replied Donavan. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s building something there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very disturbing indeed.\u201d Dimitri stared blankly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the disturbing part,\u201d Donavan chocked the words out. \u201cAgain, at the current processing rate, the machine is harming itself, overriding the second law of robotics. It\u2019s protecting someone\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Dimitri asked.\n\nExamining the contorted faces staring at him, Donavan finally spoke, \u201cSomeone not up the physical world.\u201d\n\nThe room erupted with arguments.\n\nDonavan cleared his throat then loudly continued, \u201cThe way GTPR500 works is by performing accurate simulations indistinguishable from reality. We believe it wasn\u2019t the machine\u2019s fault, it worked superbly. It was the wrong question,\u201d he looked around to see if they were following. \u201cWe asked about the nature of black holes. And insisted on comprehensive answers. That meant running all possibilities, including pocket universes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, God!\u201d Dimitri gasped as if he saw a ghost, \u201cIt didn\u2019t?!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. It did,\u201d Donavan replied looking at the baffled audience. \u201cSuns are like heavy metal balls on a stretch sheath of fabric; they create dints. And black holes are the heaviest things there are. It dents the fabric so much it creates pockets. That fabric is the spacetime we live in, and the pockets are separate spacetimes, new universes,\u201d he explained. \u201dIn short, we believe GTPR500 had simulated a miniature universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the message?\u201d Asked Dimitri.\n\n\u201cFirst contact.\u201d", "ups": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.9}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "The Captain", "text": "The Captain was far away.

She was 10 years my junior, but she ran a tight ship. \n\nOne of the things I adored about her is she would call me on my BS. \"Sam stop leaving your socks on the floor, Sam put the toilet seat down.\" Living alone for your 20's leaves bad habits deeply engrained.\n\nShe turned to me with a smirk on her face. \" I'll shower, you get to work!\"\n\n\"As you wish.\" Quoting one of the greatest movies of all times.\n\nI want to complain about having to work on household improvements on my time off from work, but my heart wouldn't be in it. In fact I'm thrilled that my wife encourages me to not lay around and read all day. \n\nThe sheet rock went faster than I had anticipated. A few screws, a bit of mudding and our basement no longer looked like a dungeon. Just as I had capped the bucket of mud I heard feet rushing down the stairs. I looked up to see my wife in all her naked glory running full boar at me. She jumped at the last second, into my arms almost toppling me over. She was planting kisses all over my face doing her best to smother me.\n\n\"We did it! We freaking did it!\"\n\nHer joy was infectious. In between giggles I asked \" What did we do? Finish the basement? I know, I'm here.\"\n\n\"No you big dumb idiot! We did it!\" She had been waving something in my face that I had been all too distracted to see. I craned my neck back to try to get a lock on the stick she was waving around haphazardly.\n\nShock took over my limps. I couldn't figure out if I needed to collapse or drop her. Luckily she had a death grip on me so she wouldn't be falling out of my arms.\n\n\"Hold the phone! Are you telling me you're pregnant?\"\n\nShe bore holes into me with her eyes before attempting to once again end me with a make out session. \" Yes!Yes!Yes!Yes! Finally! Do you have any idea how many of these damn tests I've been taking?\"\n\n\"I didn't even know we had them.\"\n\n\"Of course you didn't. I take out the bathroom trash every time I use one.\" She finally extended her legs to floor and with a final kiss on the lips she turned away from me. \"It's finally happening. I'm going to be a mother.\" The lights flickered and her voice took on a low growl.\n\nShe ever so slowly turned back around. The timely flicker of the lights made it seem like she was skipping portions of the turn. After ending her turn and staring straight at me she opened her mouth to speak.\n\n\"Beep!\"\n\n\"Beep!\"\n\n\"Beep!\"\n\n\"Beep!\"\n\nI opened my eyes and I was once again in bed alone. I lay there feeling the depths of my love for my wife and my unborn child. Knowing that they weren't real. Just something my brain created to pass the time. In the early dawn light, I could recall our wedding, our first kiss, and signing the paperwork for our house. Now all that was left of her was a seemly bottomless pit left in the center of my chest.", "ups": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.92}, {"genre": "Mystery &amp; Suspense", "title": "The Wait", "text": " \n\nThe Daedelus didn\u2019t have any way of keeping up with days or hours. That was up to Mina. And in space, time didn\u2019t matter. It was always a different day in a different year on a different planet. And Mina measured *her* time using an old wind-up clock she had taken from her small colony back on Vexus. Each thirteen-hour rotation signaled another day past. Today, she determined she\u2019d been stuck on the Daedelus for fifteen-hundred and twenty-one days. Roughly four years Vexus time.\n\nMina yawned wide, stretching out her arms as she leaned backwards over the captain\u2019s chair. Looking over the controls, she confirmed that nothing needed to be readjusted. The speed and flight path of the Daedelus was right on track to reach the planet of  Palmyra in an estimated four-hundred and fifty-eight days. \n\nWith ample time to waste, she looked around for something to do. She could pick up a book but she had already read everything this ship had to offer one-hundred times over. She could play solitaire or write in her journal but there was nothing to write of. So, instead, she waited anxiously by the comms station hoping for that familiar voice to come over the radio and wish her good morning.\n\nShe debated reaching out to him first but\u2013 no. She was sure he had other things to do and he\u2019d wait until he was alone. \n\n\u201cAlone like me,\u201d she thought. Her face fell. Right now, she wished she wasn\u2019t alone. It devastated her to remember she was the sole survivor of her disease ridden colony. Not that she could forget. The fact that she was on this ship, fleeing that god forsaken planet reminded her every day. \n\nFor what had seemed like hours, Mina stared at the ship's console, lost in her thoughts. When the lights on the comms station finally lit up, a rough, gravelly voice came over the speaker and Mina bolted up in her chair.\n\n\u201cMorning, Beautiful.\u201d\n\nMina snatched up the transmitter and rolled her eyes. A grin spread across her face as she spoke into the receiver, \u201cYou\u2019ve never actually seen me, John. I could look like Quasimodo for all you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about that. I\u2019ve seen you in my dreams every night and Quasimodo has nothing on you.\u201d\n\nA bubble of laughter escaped her throat. She couldn\u2019t help it. Every time he complimented her that way she felt giddy. Like a child who had just heard the funniest thing.\n\n\u201cPlus, I should be the one worrying about appearances. Once we meet on Palmyra you\u2019ll take one good look at me and turn your heels back around. Right now, I have the advantage of being on another ship. Sight unseen. Eventually, you\u2019ll have plenty more options.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want options. You're who I want.\u201d \n\nIt was true. She didn\u2019t need to see him to know that she loved him. She just needed him. \n\n\u201cAnd if you wanted,\u201d she teased, \u201cYou could move to Palmyra with me. I\u2019ve heard There\u2019s lots of opportunities down there. You could train for some fancy job, be a veterinarian, or a banker, or a chef. Something like that.\u201d \n\nshe chuckled to herself knowing he would hate that idea.  \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pilot Mina, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with myself down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then maybe we can get our own ship. A cargo ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll give up living on solid ground? You\u2019ll miss the opportunity to watch sunsets on the grass? To breathe in fresh air everyday? To swim in an ocean again? You\u2019d walk away from all that just to be stuck on another ship with no one but me and whatever crew we take on?\u201d\n\nMina didn\u2019t hesitate to answer. \u201cWe can look out the windows and watch the sunrise over the planets we pass by. We can watch them rise again on the other side. And as long as there is you and me, I don\u2019t care about anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere would we get the money for this ship?\u201d She could tell by the tone of his voice he was grinning. Even thought they\u2019d had this conversation so many times before it never got old.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll sell this one. Or maybe we could steal one and become intergalactic fugitives and travel across the galaxies? It\u2019d be fun to be the next Bonnie and clyde.\u201d\n\nA roar of laughter boomed out of the speaker. Though he would never admit it and they\u2019d never do it, she could tell he secretly liked the idea.\n\n\u201cI have to go Mina. I\u2019ll radio back later.\u201d He was still laughing when the transmission ended and Mina was left all alone again. She stood up and looked over the ship\u2019s course again. \u201cRight on track,\u201d she whispered, \u201cOnly four-hundred and fifty-seven more days till Palmyra.\u201d\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is my Secret Santa Story for u/DannyMethane_ \n\nMy constraints were: A veterinarian, in space, and it had to be a romance...

Julia loved to watch the powdery drift flowing off the tips of the snow dunes as the sun rose. Each glittery swirl reminded her of simpler times; times when she believed in magic. A gentle creak from behind pulled her from the moment.    \n\n\u201cGood morning, Grandma!\u201d Her grandson wore a grin as bright as the sunrise.    \n\n\u201cGood morning, sweetheart!\u201d She never could help herself from returning his enthusiasm. \u201cWould you like some pancakes for breakfast?\u201d    \n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you keep enjoying the sunrise, and I\u2019ll make *you* pancakes?\u201d Wren made his way to his grandma\u2019s rocking chair and wrapped the red and white afghan around her. He kissed her on the cheek before she could answer. It was already decided.    \n\nWren bounced to the kitchen to get started and Julia\u2019s gaze was drawn back outside to the wintery landscape. She watched snow blow around on the dunes, fall in clumps off the firs, and little creatures scamper around narrowly avoiding being buried in the tiny avalanches.     \n\nTwo squirrels found shelter under the boughs of a nearby tree. They huddled over some food or nut treasure that had miraculously appeared in the frozen tundra. They chittered loudly at one another, appearing to argue over who gets to keep it.     \n\nWren announced breakfast, so Julia once again pulled herself from the scene to join him at the table.    \n\n\u201cAbsolutely delicious!\u201d     \n\n\u201cThanks, Grandma.\u201d He looked like he wanted to say more, but didn\u2019t continue.    \n\nThey enjoyed the rest of breakfast in comfortable silence. Wren led his grandmother back toward her rocking chair, supporting her with a strong elbow crooked for her grip. However, in the middle of the living room, instead of turning toward the bay window, she tugged him toward the front door.    \n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d    \n\n\u201cI have to show you something. Get your boots and coat on.\u201d She wrestled with her own snowboots that came halfway up her calves and wrapped herself in her fluffy winter coat.    \n\nHe gazed at her in confusion but did as he was told.    \n\nOnce outside, Julia led her grandson through the snow, past the back yard, beyond the covered vegetable garden, and through a clearing in the trees. They were nearing the edge of the property farthest from other signs of civilization. The wilds.     \n\nJulia didn\u2019t slow down until she reached the wall of a cliff. There, she felt the rock face and walked a few steps from their original path. She pushed aside dormant vines and leaves crackled and fell to the ground. A short opening appeared and she slipped into it.    \n\nWren followed, speechless. It wasn\u2019t dark inside the tiny grotto. Light emanated from a babbling spring in the center. Cushions and mementos surrounded the water as if people had sat around it like a campfire.     \n\n\u201cThis is the last place I saw your grandfather. It probably will seem crazy to you, but\u2026\u201d      \n\nHer grandson was leaning closer to the water, hand reaching out\u2026     \n\n\u201cWren! Wait. Please.\u201d     \n\nHis hand snapped back to his side and he looked at her with wide eyes. \u201cIt looks like\u2026\u201d he chuckled to himself. \u201cIt looks like magic.\u201d     \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you. It *is* magic. But, magic isn\u2019t always good. This spring will rejuvenate anyone that drinks from it, no matter age or illness.\u201d Her eyes were fixed hard on his; she would not let him take this lightly. \u201cYour grandfather is not dead.\u201d     \n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d    \n\nShe gave him a moment to process the information before continuing. \u201cI know, we had the funeral and\u2026 I know! It\u2019s crazy! Just listen, please.\u201d     \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand, Grandma.\u201d There was pain on his face now, grin lines turned to frown lines in one secret sentence.     \n\n\u201cHe drank. We lived here our whole married lives and agreed that when our kids and our grandkids were old enough to be left to live their lives, we\u2019d start ours over. But, I changed my mind. I couldn\u2019t bear to leave you and the rest of the family. He still drank. He left.\u201d    \n\n\u201cOh, Grandma. I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t believe any of this. It\u2019s all insane and just, god. You must be hurting so much right now.\u201d He had stepped closer and took Julia in his arms.    \n\nShe patted him on the back as she told him, \u201cI know it was the right thing to do. I\u2019m not sad.\u201d     \n\nHe pulled away enough to look at her face, and sure enough, she was happy. Not a tear welled in her eyes.    \n\n\u201cI just knew it was time to pass along the secret since I don\u2019t know how much time I have left.

Bads had opened the gym years ago to train himself since there was nothing in the area and climbing actual rocks had become quite dangerous after they burned the sky. He discovered that contrary to popular belief, managing a place like this takes away from precious wall time even if he lived there. \n\nKel had joined on a few months ago. Apparently no one wanted to hire a reformed convict. As she tells it, she accidentally threw a bit of dynamite out of a car she had stolen and ruined some classic Grecian concrete facade of a historic building. A count of grand theft auto and reckless endangerment later landed her behind bars for thirteen years. It was hard to believe that she had been behind bars for the entire run of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She often said it was the worst of times, but she got through by being as clever as a jackdaw and as fierce as a wyvern. \n\nShe had been upfront about the void on her resume and had great people skills too when he trialed her out. Her blithe demeanor made customers forget about the world outside while they were here. It was an easy hire. It took some time for her to get used to living at the gym since affording a private residence was nearly impossible for any but the elites. She\u2019d often ask questions like Is there a chemist shop nearby? or Is the chimney supposed to be blocked? The answers which were no and yes, unless you want your lungs to corrode respectively. She had gotten used to the place quickly and even gotten to know the other people in the area. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the lunchbox today?\u201d Bads asked, pulling out a ham sandwich.\n\n\u201cApfelstrudel, chocolate truffles, and sugar cookies with ginger frosting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should probably eat something more than desserts, you know.\u201d\n\nMouth full, Kel muttered something unintelligible as sweet crumbs fell to the table.\n\n\u201cTry that again as a civilized adult?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are too delicious not to. Plus we get plenty of nutrients from the shipments from Halex.

You have to survive the deaths of your loved ones, sickness, and aging, you have to watch your own body fail you. Without me, you would never appreciate the beauty of life.

I reached a crosswalk, waiting with all the others walking for the red hand to change. But then something strange happened.\n\nThe people around me stopped talking. The cars driving stopped moving. Everyone froze mid-step on the other end of the street. Everything seemed to be frozen in time. I wondered, did I do this? I tried to move, but my body didn't respond.

I knew in an instant that he must've been the one to do this. I felt secure, knowing that the man would have his fun, but eventually, everyone would resume their daily lives. Perhaps not right away, if everyone else was seeing what I did, assuming we even remembered this at all upon unfreezing.\n\nThe man continued to walk around the streets, shouting, singing, laughing, doing anything he wanted with no shame. I laughed, if only in spirit. Oh, how funny it would be if he unfroze time and realized everyone had seen and heard everything he had done.\u00a0\n\nThen it stopped being amusing. The man's jovial laughs became coughs, loud and ragged. He walked, stopping on the crosswalk right in front of me. His arms were clutching his sides, his legs looking like they'd collapse at any given moment. Then he dropped to the ground and stopped breathing.\n\nI waited. And waited. And waited some more. The man who had caused this had died. Right in front of me, even. I don't know how or why, but there he was. So why couldn't I move still? Time was frozen in that same moment, and I was still staring at that stupid red hand.\u00a0\n\nI was stuck. I couldn't look around, couldn't move, couldn't breathe or blink.

I want to scream at the top of my lungs. I want to cry. I want to fall to my knees and bury my head in my knees. I want to go up to the man and kill him a second time.\n\nBut I can't do any of that.

And the tears rolled down his cheek as he wished that he was still there, laying next to his love, but alas war gives no such pleasures, and he must earn that right.\n\nSuddenly a dark sky flashed. An enemy bomber was roaring its engines over the battlefield, and the group of poorly trained recruits knew that it was time for fight or flight, and none of them had more strength left for combat. As they saw the bomber open its belly, spitting out hundreds of angry bombs, they finally stood up. In front of them was a machine gun nest, to their side a group of mean commandos, and behind bombs were dropping.\n\nThey all ran towards an empty side as bombs and bullets were chasing them, none of them catching, but a blast wave did knock them down. Gunfire was still going on, and as an aftermath of a strong explosion radiated in one young soldier's head, his vision blurry, his hearing nonexistent, only the beats of his heart were heard. He looked up and saw his friend emerging from a crater, he offered him his hand, and as he took it, he saw a bullet hole appearing on his friend's chest, with his last words being: \"SAVE YOURSELF!\". Our young soldier did not look back, but shortly after he realized that he is the sole survivor of his group. He felt sorry for his friend that gave his life for him, but now he needed to earn that, so he just kept running and running and running. \"Why must one fall so other could rise?\" Were his thoughts as he ran, then he felt a sharp stab in his back, and he looked down. There was just one huge hole near to his heart, and it was bleeding and bleeding as our soldier took what he thought are going to be his last steps thinking: \"Or is there no such thing as a right sacrifice\". Then he fell facedown in the mud.

Even worse, the pay scales in academia are a joke compared to industry. \n\nLuckily for me I somehow worked my way into a decent paying lab tech job in one of the research groups at the hospital. My boss (whose name I can\u2019t say, I\u2019ll explain later) was probably the most successful and well-funded researcher in the entire research division. Our group would crank out several publications in a single year in Nature, Cell, New England Journal of Medicine you name it. (Not bragging but I made co-author on one of the papers!). \n\nMy job as a lab tech was actually pretty easy. A lot of it was the usual lab stuff that no one here would care about but where I really excelled was apparently my ability to grow tumours. I never understood how I did it but my boss and some of the other post docs would grow tumours on me and somehow I could grow them faster than the other techs. The solid tumours were the easiest like melanoma and lung cancer, even some of the rarer ones like bone cancers. I would consider those an easy project. For obvious reasons I absolutely drew the line at testicular cancer. My boss and I had a long discussion about it but even he knew I wasn\u2019t budging on that one. The worst was leukaemia. I hated it and so did the other techs. If you\u2019ve ever had a bone marrow biopsy you\u2019d know what I was talking about. That hurt like a son of a bitch! So as a rule you\u2019d only have to do a leukaemia project once a year. \n\nAnyway, after they, or I should say I, had grown the tumour my boss or some of the other post docs would then either excise the tumour or give me a drug to try and reduce it in size. From this we would get some of the most amazing and ground-breaking data in the field. My boss would give these talks at conferences and I\u2019m not kidding, other prominent researchers would lose their shit! \n\nBut here\u2019s what happened and this is how I lost my job. Goddam OHS. \n\nTwo weeks ago some OHS representatives came to give a talk to our lab. Turns out, my boss hadn\u2019t been filling out the proper paperwork to be working on human subjects. The ethics committee were losing their minds and we had to stop research on humans immediately. They were however allowed to continue their research but only using mice. And that\u2019s how I lost my job to goddam mouse!\n\nMe and the other lab techs were pretty much sent packing that day. We had to sign an NDA, which is why I can\u2019t mention my boss\u2019 name.

Ruler. \n\nIn search for a purpose, we decided to give ourselves something to do. Some became rulers of empires. Some adjudicators. I was the only one who resorted to becoming an observer.

He is the second host to notice my presence. We see what our host sees. We experience everything that happens to them. But make no mistake. We feel no pain nor emotion related to their stimulus. Its like.. I am another conciousness at the back of his mind. When a host die, we simply find another host in the Labyrinth.  \n\nThe Labyrinth is a place where all things are connected. Its like an infinite pathway for all things. Nemos are free to pick their host with only one restriction. We agreed not to pick a soul of a person who experienced death and then came back to life. The reason behind that is when the  I picked a resuscitated patient, the poor soul saw what the I saw in all of my existence. Yes he came back alive but almost went  insane. \n\nQ is seeing a familiar scene. He has seen this event may times. This is the same dream that keeps on showing from time to time. There are 2 images of Q. one lying on the floor and the other one sitting on the former's chest. The latter holding a broken shard of glass and continuously slitting the throat of the first one. \n\nThe sheer amount of blood dripping doesnt bother him anymore. He has been trying to understand what could be the meaning of his recurring dream.. or nightmare. \n\n even I, an entity who lived countless lives cannot explain what is happening to his mind. We Nemos cannot forget. We remember everything perfectly as if things happened seconds ago. I am sure as hell that this is the first time that I saw a dream like that. \n\nSummer.\n\nQ is an interesting kid. He likes the idea of helping others but hates people. He tries his best to avoid direct human contact. \n\nThere was this time that A kid was lost in his work place.

After i settle matters with this kid show yourself in my dream.\"\n\nI have never been this excited before. Thrill sets in. A soul recognized me? It has been 67 years since a soul recognized my presence. Will this kid be able to handle the price? \n\nKnowing our presence is a death sentence for them. Nemos agree that Once the host knows about us, they will be given a \"gift\". \n\nThat night I gave him the perfect gift for him. A curse of seeing other people's dream. He will be an observer in a way. But theres a catch. Everytime the host uses it, they lose their conciousness. This enables us to take over the body for a certain period of time. \n\nThe first time Q used it was disastrous. He used it to a dying friend of his. He was overwhelmed on how vivid the scene was. As if he was the one experiencing the dream. He ended up all exhausted and then passed out. Of course I didn't waste any time. This was my chance to take over. \n\n\nLabyrinth.\n\nI found him. I had to search for the first soul to recognize Nemos. Hes a unique individual if i may say. He didn't flipped after he saw everything. Coming back to life was a bad thing for him.

I am lucky in a way that i am not you.\"\n\n\"You are me. And i am you.\" \n\"I am an observer of things. I do not interfere. But as you have seen, being an observer is a curse.

Her neighbour Mike discovered likewise for cows, and for a while Modajo enjoyed her eggs and Mike enjoyed his milk since the concept of sharing was as foreign then as it is now.\n\nWatching Mike tending to his cows one day, Modajo realised cows aren't chickens therefore milk isn't egg and she caught the first ever case of curiosity.  \n\"Mike, has it occurred to you cows aren't chickens therefore milk isn't egg?\"  \n\"Holy Cow!\", Mike exclaimed, shocked by how he hadn't noticed this obvious fact until that moment. When he finally calmed down from bewilderment a full day later, Modajo continued.  \n\"I'll trade you a dozen eggs for a liter of milk.\"  \n\"What's dozen and liter?\"  \n\"Random units of measurement I just made up.\"  \n\"I accept.\"  \nAnd so the first barter took place, which continued each morning hence.\n\nA week later while out for a walk, Modajo happened upon a lady who had perfected the art of creating protective cocoons from leaves to wear on her feet while walking. She called them shoos for they shoo'd away painful foot blisters. Intrigued, Modajo made an offer.  \n\"Shoemaker, I\u2019ll trade you 2 dozen eggs for a new pair of shoes.\"  \nShoemaker wasn\u2019t impressed. \"Firstly, there's something weird with how you're saying \u2018shoo\u2019 but I can't quite place it. Secondly, Papa had complications after eating eggs and I assume his condition runs in the family like our sensitive feet. We do enjoy milk though.\"\n\nModajo foresaw the hassle of exchanging eggs for milk whenever she needed shoos - which would be every 2 days - so she gathered Mike, Shoemaker and several other locals for a meeting.  \n\"My People, we need something to represent the value of goods when said goods aren\u2019t immediately available.\"  \nThey stared blankly at her as a cricket chirped away nearby.  \n\"This is Tito, a wholesaler,\" she continued, while pulling out a golden leaf. \"He created these special leaves called money. One money is the equivalent of a half-dozen eggs. So Mike, a liter of milk is worth two money. And Shoemaker\u2026\"  \n\"Shoomaker,\" quipped Shoemaker.  \n\"Yes Shoemaker, a pair of your shoes is worth 4 money.\u201d  \n\u201cMoney is also the first noun in existence whose plural form is the same as its singular,\u201d Tito added, much to the small crowd's amusement.\n\nModajo continued explaining how she could, for example, exchange 6 dozen eggs for 12 golden leaves with Tito, spend 4 on shoes and have enough left over for two more pairs without ever involving Mike. Shoemaker could then exchange his leaves for goods of equal value with any other participant, notably Tito. The idea took off and soon the golden leaf became the standard unit of exchange. The town came to be known as Golden Leaf Village.\n\nTito became the first wealthy person in existence. He had actually introduced himself to Modajo as a \u2018hustler\u2019 but she misheard him and he was too lazy to correct her. He stored the goods he acquired at a second home which became known as a 'store'. Unbeknownst to the others, he invented the golden leaf for nefarious reasons after discovering people like shiny things. \u201cI\u2019ll use this to trick people into giving me their possessions,\u201d he thought while creating the leaves. \u201cWhat\u2019s theirs will be mine.

I know how it sounds, but let me explain. I love to take a simple glance at a stranger and invent their entire life story. That woman you queued behind at the supermarket? She\u2019s a single mother, her three children, all under the age of 5, struggling to survive. Of course, I could be, and most likely am, completely wrong. She might be heading home to her spouse, or to an empty house, or even to no house at all. I have no idea. But I have instinct. I have this odd feeling that I\u2019m right. Each and every time. Deep down, I know that each observation I make is entirely true. And in my profession, it makes all the difference.\n\nThings have been slow recently. I\u2019ve been slow. None of my stories seem quite right. That was, until, I saw her. She sat across from me on the metro, staring down at her phone. It was nothing out of the ordinary. But then, she moved. She flipped her hair back, read something off of her phone, and smiled. It was brief. Only for a second did that grin cross her face. But I saw it. And it made all the difference. My mind began to spin, running through every single possibility I could conjure up. Maybe a family member was having a baby? Maybe she was having a baby? Or maybe it was something simple, an \u201cI love you\u201d from the one she cares about, perhaps. Or maybe, just maybe, it was something sick. Something twisted. The passing of a loved one. A friend in danger. Maybe she smiled so briefly because she knew it was wrong. But this thought exited my mind as quickly as it had appeared. What were the chances of this woman being a sociopath? Highly unlikely.\n\nOf course, it was something mundane. Like a turning cog in my head, I waited for my brain to land on an explanation. And then it came. Her loved one was far away. Much too far away to keep a stable relationship. But they had. And the smile? The reasoning was simple. I was almost dismayed at how long it took me to work it out. Her lover was coming back to her. Whether they were taking the next flight or had only just booked, I had no idea. But that was her story.\n\nDo you see?\nDo you see now why I love this so much?\nI can ignore my boring life and think about all the adventures that other people have. I began to imagine the reunion. Maybe they would embrace. Maybe she would drop whatever she was holding and run towards them, like in a movie. Or maybe she would simply smile, like she had just then. I didn\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell the future; just the present. I sighed, my shoulders falling, a small, brief smile gracing my face. Just like hers. \n\nFor the remainder of the ride, I stayed deep in thought about this girl and her mystery lover. That was, until, the train came to a grinding halt at the station. I knew it wasn\u2019t my stop, so I started to close my eyes, leaning back more in my chair. But she stood. She stood up, brushing the dust from her lap and beginning to make her way towards the platform. I told myself it didn\u2019t matter; that I didn\u2019t care about this stranger. But I did. I cared more about her and her story than anything in my life. I had to know. So I stood. I brushed the dust from my lap. And I followed her onto the platform. And all the way home. \n\nI had no idea where I was, but I didn\u2019t even care. My mind was clouded by excitement, at anticipation for seeing how this story continued. She paused outside one of the homes, most likely hers, and turned. She looked one way down the street, and then the other. And then down at her watch. What was she waiting for? Or who was she waiting for? My heart began to pound. It was almost ironic; I thought I must have been more excited than her. \n\nI - no, we, - waited there for almost an hour. Nobody came. I was angry. Disappointed. In fact, scratch that - I was furious. How could they have left me hanging like this? Left on the edge of my seat, barely even breathing, and they had disappointed me. Of course they had. They always did.\n\nBut she looked worse. She had crumpled down onto the concrete, head in her knees, sobbing. It was muffled from across the street, but I could tell she was weeping. She lifted her head up for a moment - the same way she had lifted her head on the train - and I saw the tears lining her face like a periwinkle glitter. \nBefore I could even tell what I was doing, I took a step into the street. And another. And another. And before I knew it, I was sprinting towards this poor, poor girl. She didn\u2019t know me, of course, but she needed the comfort. She needed my comfort. And she was going to get it. I realised how close I was standing to her, towering over her crumpled figure like some kind of twisted, humanoid lighthouse. She didn\u2019t even lift her head. Rude, I thought, but she was sad. I couldn\u2019t blame her. I knelt down, my knees rough against the concrete pavement. \n\nShould I speak?\n\nI tried.\n\nI opened my mouth, my throat dry and lips chapped, but no sound came from my decaying mouth. Not even a hoarse groan. Nothing. So instead. I raised my skeletal hand to her shoulder. \nI\u2019m so sorry this had to happen to you, I thought in my head.\nNo one deserves this.\nAnd as my hand fell, fell towards her shoulder, it never hit.\nI phased straight through her.\nLike always. \nMy piteous smile turned into a grimace. My other hand swung up, down through her back, and into the concrete. I tried to grab her face, to lift up her beautiful head, to wipe away the tears, but all I felt was air.\n\nMy love, I\u2019m sorry, I tried to scream.\nI didn\u2019t mean to leave you here alone. \nI tried to come, I did, I swear.\nI just never made it. \nIt wasn\u2019t my fault, but it also isn\u2019t yours. \nYou could never do anything wrong.\nMy love.\nMy love.\nMy love.\n\nI shut my eyes tight, praying, wishing, begging I could embrace her once more. Pleading with the universe to allow me to explain myself.\n\nAnd yet, when I opened my eyes; nothing had changed. \n\nI\u2019m back on the metro, sat across from the most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever seen. She flips her hair and smiles; smiles at my text message.\nI can\u2019t wait to see you again, it reads. \nShe types back. \nI never get her message. \nBecause a block away from her home, I\u2019m dead with a bullet wound in my head.

Even in the dimly lit bar I had to shield my eyes. I could see... I could see!\n\nI heard the creaking of wood as the man climbed up from the chair. He held out his hand to help me up. The long black nails scratched my wrist as I accepted it. \n\n\"Nice to see you again Lucifer.\" I said as I stared into the pools of tar he had for eyes.\n\n\"No need to be formal with me.\" He sat back on the chair. \"This is a simple trade just like before. \" \n\nAs Lucifer sipped his drink, I retrieved a locket tucked beneath my shirt.

Lucifer was still old fashioned in his methods apparently. The front door squeaked ever so slightly as I entered the sleeping house. The scent of cinnamon greeted me. I dodged shoes and toys as I made my way towards the stairs. I stopped at the foot of them noticing that someone was asleep on the couch. A child.\n\n\"Sick fuck.\" I whispered under my breath.\n\nHow was I any better than him? If I didn't do this I'd go back to being alone and blind, drinking my life away. That was reason enough for me to continue. I ascended the stairs.\n\nI entered the room where my target lie sleeping. Inching closer and closer to the bed I raised the dagger. I loomed over the mound of blankets before plunging the dagger downward as hard as I could. Moonlight illuminated the room the very second the dagger struck, no more unnatural darkness. I caught sight of my target's face and staggered back as my heart sunk. It was my wife.\n\nHer eyes were open and she was fully conscious as I embraced her bleeding body.

I bolted out of my bed and got ready as fast as I could. I took my vibrant masterpiece, leaning against the dull wall. It was the most complex painting I had ever made. Every color, every stroke, every pixel on the canvas, masterfully crafted with the precision of the finest bristle of the brush. After the labor of 100 hours, this was my most complex masterpiece, sure to win the contest.\n\nI reached the art studio where the contest was being held. Confidence filled my stomach as I glided to my seat and saw other artists hanging their paintings on the wall. I sat down next to my masterpiece, ready for the judges to see and admire my work.\n\nThe crowd of art enthusiasts started pouring in, and after a few minutes, they filled the place to the brim. Many people came and appreciated my work, but I didn\u2019t need them to tell me how good my painting was; I made it and I knew how good it was. \n\nThe three judges emerged from the crowd and I stood up, welcoming them. They stood and stared at my painting. I tried to read their body language, but their stoic faces didn\u2019t tell me a thing. \n\n\u201cWhat was your artistic intention behind it?\u201d One of the judges asked.\n\nI repeated the speech I had prepared a hundred times. \u201cThe Garden at the end of time is made on a 18 by 24-inch, double primed, pre-stretched canvas with around 54 different shades of colors, making it one of the most intricate paintings. The painting warrants a calm feeling in the viewer\u2019s mind, making them remember a timeless memory of warmth and comfort. By this piece of art, I want the viewers to be mesmerised by the beauty of a garden.\u201d\n\nThey nodded and moved on, while I took a long breath and sat down again on my chair. That went well. I talked with other art enthusiasts when I heard the announcement.\n\n\u201cThe judges will soon announce the results. Meanwhile, you all are free to have complimentary snacks and appreciate your fellow peers,\u201d a voice shouted on the intercom.\n\nI roamed around and saw my competition. I was being generous, calling them my competition. It shocked me, seeing the amount of abstract and minimalist artists appearing with their pointless art when I saw the dullest painting I had ever seen in my life. An antithesis to my masterpiece. It was a black and white painting made from charcoal and white paint. The title of the painting was \u2018A simple masterpiece\u2019. Thinking of the ego just behind the idea of considering this piece of trash a \u2018masterpiece\u2019 flabbergasted me. Those uber-pretentious minimalists think they make art when they smear white paint on white background. Even the wall in my painting studio had much better texture than this so-called \u2018art\u2019.\n\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d A short woman, bursting with excitement, said while standing behind me.\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d I lied. \u201cYou uh\u2026 certainly capture the essence of um\u2026 of minimalism that Enrico Castellani expressed, if I am not wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you are absolutely right. He is one of my role models. I am Tahani by the way, Tahani Minhaj\u201d\n\n\u201cAnaya Shah. Nice to meet you.\u201d\n\nWe shook hands and shared silence, looking at the painting, until Tahani said. \u201cI like to think the minimalist paintings involve not only the artist but the viewers too, in interpreting the meaning of the painting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but what about the intentions behind the artist? Without the context and the idea from the maker of the painting, people can make innumerable opinions. The artist may have one thing in mind, and it may be interpreted as another.\u201d\n\n\u201cA painting is a window, showing the way to the stars. People can see other stars, but it doesn\u2019t diminish the shine of others. The intention of the artist must always be to make the window as clean as possible, not cloud it with their own meanings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWoah, that\u2019s deep,\u201d I said to that freshman-level philosophy bullshit.\n\nShe snickered and said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s just something my father used to say. So, what do you see in my painting?\u201d\n\nMy gut urged me to say nothing valuable, but I said, \u201cIt is simple yet bold.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that your painting right there?\u201d She curiously asked me.\n\nShe walked over to my masterpiece and said, \u201cIt\u2019s so\u2026 vibrant. Garden at the end of time,\u201d she read the title of the painting.\n\n\u201cThanks, it took me days to complete the three-layer structure for the landscape.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour hard work shows. I rarely love traditional expressionism, but this is really something else. The three-layer depth is a nice touch. I think you might win.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s modest of you. Your painting also deserves the utmost honor.\u201d\n\nThe intercom buzzed and the same voice again said, \u201cKindly gather around the main stage for the award ceremony.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, see you around. May the best artist win.\u201d We shook our hands and like birds flocking to the nest, so did every other person in the exhibit.\n\nThe announcer and the three judges stood with three awards in their hands, the smallest being for the third position and the largest for the first. I heard the first one calling my name and attracting me like a magnet. I got so enchanted by the gold lining of the award that I couldn\u2019t hear the announcements until they said my name.\n\n\u201cThe second prize goes to Anaya Shah.\u201d\n\nThe spotlight pointed at me, and it left me speechless. Second place! How could I get second place? I sluggishly walked towards the front stage and accepted the second-place award with a forced smile.\n\n\u201cAnd the winner of the first prize is Tahani Minhaj.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t hear what the announcer just said. How could she, a minimalist, of all people, win the contest? Pictures were taken, paintings were sold and connections with art critics and museum\u2019s curators were made, all the while I silently cried inside.\n\n\u201cSee, I knew you would win,\u201d Tahani said to me with the widest smile I had ever seen.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to you too,\u201d I said with my teeth clenched and stomach burning. My jaw was about to snap from all the fake smiling. \u201cI wanted to ask you what you said when the judges asked you about the artistic intention of your painting?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same thing I said to you. I just showed them a window, and they saw their own intentions and interpretations.\u201d\n\nI went home after the party and sat dumbfounded on the floor in my painting studio, facing the wall. What was so special about that minimalist art? I flew splashes around and that\u2019s it? What was it compared to my hard work?\n\nI felt lonely staring at the mundane wall.  I must\u2019ve seen this wall a thousand times, day and night while working on my painting, but now I saw it in a new light. It\u2019s small, almost unnoticeable cracks and splatters of paint coursing through like a river. I leaned on the cold and smooth feel of concrete. It must\u2019ve been hours, in the deadly silent shift of night to morning, but I didn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t move until I figured out what made abstract things so mesmerizing. I saw a slight blotch of paint flying above a series of the same color of paint stains. Although I thought myself to be above my peers, I had failed to see that I was one of them, an artist.\n\n\u201cI see your value now.\u201d", "ups": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.83}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "Scorpion Of The Stars", "text": "\n\nThe vagrant had always been a harmless nuisance, Dorothy Ballantyne thought.\n\nOld Roger, as he was known in her neighborhood, was lying in the alley between Hocksworthy's Books and Rupert's Delicatessen, his eyes glazed over in an alcoholic stupor and barely aware of his surroundings.\n\nDorothy's mother, Evelyn, tightened her gloved hand and pulled her daughter closer as they walked past him, while her father stared straight ahead and pretended not to notice the pitiable man.\n\nThe young girl looked up at her father and frowned. Ever since he had returned from the war her father's character had changed almost imperceptibly. Her mother hadn't seemed to notice it but she had, now and again, in little things. Her mother typically ignored Roger, but her father had always acted kindly towards him, giving him a coin or stopping to say hello.\n\nShe caught a whiff of Roger's foul body odour, and moved with pity, was going to ask her mother if she could give him two pence when the homeless man came alive and shouted the first words Dorothy had ever heard.\n\n\"Get away from them!

He still had his quick wits from the battlefield and effortlessly put Roger into a headlock, knocked the knife from his hand, flipped him on his stomach and pinned him there until a nearby bobby ran over and handcuffed him.\n\nBy now the whole neighborhood was gawking at the commotion, totally out of place for this leafy London street on a quiet Sunday evening.\n\n\"You're all going to die! you hear?\", Roger bellowed at the top of his lungs.

It\u2019s an exciting life, being a trekker, but without jokes and banter, soon you start to feel tired. But not us. We\u2019ve been in the jungle for 3 weeks so far, and nothing bar a few moths and spiders have come to see us. Yesterday the trees moved in what might have been some monkey business, but even with the binos, all we saw was green and disappointment.\n\nGreen fills the jungle at day. The trees, the snakes, the ground; it\u2019s all full of green. It\u2019s a beautiful, peaceful green, coming in varying shades, a calm in the midst of the chattering noise. But at night, everything changes. The bright, vibrant green gives way to the comforting night. A blackness which fills everything, yet harms nothing.

I scour the ground, yet I can\u2019t find any footprints, which strikes me as strange. Everything, no matter how small and light, leaves traces, so why doesn\u2019t this?\n\nI must have imagined it.

He does it through a combination of ancient magic, plastic surgery, and lots of lithium. Once they're too withered to work, he grinds them up into reindeer feed.   \n\nIt took a lot of work to get proof of all this, and a lot of sacrifice. You've lost friends, good ones who helped you the whole way through your quest, who were taken by the very man you aimed to expose. But now you're ready to finally tell the world what he really is.   \n\nThe news makes quite a splash. Santa Claus, the beloved holiday figure, is actually some sort of inhuman horror who preys upon the world's children. The people are shocked and outraged at first, but then Santa Claus comes on TV and says that you can't believe whatever some random person says, and that come on, I'm Santa Claus, and he ho-ho-hos a few times and the newscaster gives a smile and then the next day there's debate over whether what you said is true.   \n\nYou have so much proof, not least of which are dozens of actual kids who tell their stories of being abducted by Santa Claus and taken to the North Pole to be subjected to the horrors of elfhood. But the reaction on social media is that's just some actor, that's not really a missing kid, how can that possibly be, that's clearly a Christmas elf, not a child! So then you release documentation, stuff like sworn testimony and surveillance video and DNA tests, but people say the elf was lying, that video can be faked, and are we sure DNA is even real in the first place?   \n\nSo you release more evidence, as well as detailed flow charts that help explain its context, and while there are still some skeptics, most eventually agree your position is unassailable: Santa Claus did indeed kidnap children and force them into slavery. The conversation immediately shifts to whether those kids were on the naught or nice list. Because, says thousands of people on the Internet, if they were naughty, then surely they must have done something to deserve it. Things like that don't happen to nice children.   \n\nYou don't want to dignify this line of thinking at first, because why should it matter whether they were naughty or nice? What Santa did to them was terrible! But eventually you release a copy of both lists that you stole during the course of your investigation. It shows that while some of the children were naughty, most of them were nice.   \n\nFaced with this evidence, social media chooses to focus instead on whether it was ethical to steal that list in the first place, and that should we really be encouraging people to just take whatever information they want from people (and/or beloved holiday icons)? And furthermore, should we really be judging Santa Claus by the same standards we judge everyone else anyway? He has a very important job, after all, so who are we to dictate what he should or shouldn't do anyway?  People start saying you should be prosecuted for leaking sensitive documents.  \n\nThings look pretty grim, until a couple of elves you didn't even know about come forward to give a group interview on cable news. They tell the interviewer that Santa Claus turned them into elves too, but what makes them different is they are from rich families. Their parents had stepped in to rescue them (and only them) from the North Pole years before you even started your investigation. The interviewer asks what evidence they have that what they're saying is true. They say pretty much all the same things you've been saying this whole time, though in a slightly more posh accent.   \n\nThe next day world opinion turns against Santa Claus. Congressional inquiries are called. Prosecutors are enlisted. Police arrive at the North Pole. Santa Claus is arrested.   \n\nThe trial takes the better part of a year. There are many times when it seems that Santa\u2014who had hired the most sadistic, vicious and outright poisonous lawyers money could buy\u2014would get away. But eventually, after a brutal legal battle, he is finally found guilty. He goes to jail for the rest of his life, which is a very long time for an immortal spirit.

He ran and ran across the world decorating the inside of every building. Giving each one a personality he saw fit. What would once take him a month only took a few days, he was even faster now. Soon he was finished, everything had been fixed and decorated. It was like nothing bad had ever happened. But eventually he started to think once more, \u201cI decorated and designed how I saw fit\u201d. The rural farmer would not have a painting of a cityscape on his wall. It would be impossible to figure out the interests of every single person on Earth and what they would want in their homes. There just wasn\u2019t enough time to do it. But for the blur this wasn\u2019t an issue, he had all the time in the world and all the speed to do it. He started inspecting the belongings in every single house, deducing what they liked, their interests, and their dislikes. So he began, carefully taking in the consideration of everyone to have lived.\n\nZipping across each street, house to house, bedroom to bedroom. He decorated in a way that they would have liked it, in a way that would not have told you it was the work of man losing himself. As he finished he thought to himself what more could he do? Everything looked better now, what more was he missing? As fast as the blur was, his thoughts started catching up to him. He could no longer keep himself busy with mindless work that would not please anyone except him. No matter how powerful one may be, every human needs companionship. He started a fruitless search around the world, there had to be at least ONE person left. He searched and searched, shelters, houses, schools, valleys, mountains, deserts. Every nook and cranny he searched, all he found were corpses.\n\nThe blur then had his next idea \u201cIf I couldn\u2019t save them in life, than I could honor them in death.\u201d He began digging, he used a shovel at first but eventually realized it would be faster to just use his hands. As quickly as he bloodied his hands crudely thrusting them into the ground, they healed even quicker. In minutes he had buried dozens of people, a pile of dirt from the graves he had dug out began to rise. Another minute goes by, and soon a hill has taken shape. After a few minutes thousands had been buried, he was even faster now. A mountain started to form, eventually it began to tower over the tallest buildings. Hours had passed, everyone had been laid to rest. A mountain that put any skyscraper, mountain, or cloud to shame with its height had formed.\n\nIt was a monument, a monument to not just the blur\u2019s failure. But to the failure of humanity, a failure to realize to bring doom upon their enemies, that they had also brought doom upon those undeserving of it. The blur was left running, running to find something that wasn\u2019t there. Whether it was purpose, companionship, or a way to undo it all. He was left running at speeds thought impossible. He was losing his grip, as for every day, hour, minute, and even second that had gone by. He had began to lose himself Even Faster Now.", "ups": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.89}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "The Light", "text": "It was a cold winter night. I just turned 9. I used to share a room with my elder brother. That night I was unable to sleep. I've tried counting numbers which usually works, but I had no luck that night. A light blinking far away caught my attention through the window. It was a small light that was clearly visible due to the pitch black night. After staring at it continuously for about five minutes, the light started blinking rapidly as it dimmed. I tried to look at it with more concentration and I blinked. After closing my eyes and opening them, I realized that it was morning. I was still in the same position, but it was morning. But how? I didn't sleep. I just blinked. Once. It was hard for me to comprehend what had happened. The next night, it was the same. My eyes were focused on that light, and soon after I blinked, it was morning again.\n\nIt was a holiday, so I decided to go to that location where the light might be located. In spite of my attempts to tell my friends about the light, they never believed me. So I had to go alone. Several people were in the park, children were playing, and parents were accompanying their children. There were a few food trucks nearby. There was nothing out of the ordinary. I found a lamp post at a distance after searching everywhere. It was at the end of the park and was the tallest. My eyes were fixed on it as I approached it. As it was daytime, there was no light. So I decided to return home. The light flashed for a second right before I was about to turn back, or at least I thought it did. It felt weird. I came back home and the day passed. Each day after school, I spent a week staring at the lamp in the park.\n\nI was in the park with my family one day. I had an elder brother and a younger sister. After eating a sandwich, we left our parents to play with the kids. While playing, I took the ball and threw it at THAT lamp post. I remember it, I definitely threw at it and I saw the bulb breaking. In a matter of microseconds, the ball hit my sister on the head. The lamp was nowhere near her. When I looked at the lamp again, it wasn't broken. I saw my sister crying as she ran towards my parents. I threw the ball at her, she said. My brother said the same. But I didn't, I tried to explain it to my parents but they wouldn't believe me. I was angry at them so I ran away.\n\nI reached the lamp and started kicking it. In an instant, the lamp post disappeared and I fell. It was pitch black, but I could see everything around me in some sort of limbo. I saw a lot of lamp posts around me. I walked towards one, but I was not getting closer to it. There were some weird sounds audible that weren't clear, but they were oddly satisfying. I felt like I was in a dream. I felt a cold breeze touch my neck. As soon as I turned around, it went BLANK.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I was not at the park or at home. I was in front of a diner. I wasn't sure how I got there. On my way back to our home, I noticed a few changes in our neighborhood. I reached home. A new and different car was parked outside. There was no sign of our car. I knocked on the door because it was locked. The door opened after a while. As soon as the door opened a woman hugged me and started crying. I didn't understand what was going on. She grabbed my hand and took me inside. She screamed, \"Honey, he's home!\". A man almost ran into the living room and hugged me. Weird. Thank goodness, you're back, Mike. We were worried about you. Are you hurt? Are you okay? \", he asked me. I nodded. Two kids walked into the living room. The girl smiled. The boy gave me a toy car. My eyes caught sight of a photograph, a family picture. It was a picture of a man, a woman, two kids, and me. What? \"Where's mom?\", I asked the man. \"Right here, Mikey\", the woman replied. I was terrified. \"Go take a bath and then we'll have dinner\", said the man. There were a few changes here and there, but it was our home. My room was the first place I went. Nothing has changed. I still have the bunk bed. Only that there was this kid instead of my brother. It didn't make sense to me. We had dinner after I took a bath. I went back to bed. I was unable to sleep. My eyes searched through the window for that light, but it wasn't there. After a few days, I asked mom (the woman) what happened the day I disappeared. She said that I had a fight with my brother and ran away from home. My thoughts turned to what really happened when I returned to my room.\n\nI decided to go to the park the next day. After breakfast, I walked to the park with my brother. It turned out that there was no park at that location. My brother told me the park is near the diner. We went there. I checked the spot where I woke up. Nothing was there. I spent days trying to figure out what was going on. I started to get these dreams about my past. It took me a few months to give up. Although I was sad not to be able to find out what happened to me or where my family was, I accepted my new family.\n\nTen years later, I'm still not sure what really happened. Not that I complain about the family I have right now, but I still miss my FAMILY. Every night, I hope that the lamp's light will return. It might never happen. Now it's time for me to go to bed, stare at the window in search of the light, and hope that everything would be back to normal when I wake up.

It\u2019s the only thing that makes any sense. First, he dresses EXACTLY like  Dracula, all the time, even when alone in the house. Second, you never see him in the day, only at  night. And third, even though he has a kitchen, you\u2019ve never seen him eat, and even though he has a  bathroom, you never see him use it. \n\nYou learned all these things over the past few weeks, shortly after getting a telescope for your  birthday. You\u2019ve been watching him, every so often, through his windows. It\u2019s how you discovered his  peculiarities. It kind of scares you, really, but you keep watching, night after night. Sometimes he\u2019s on  the couch in the living room, reading a book. Sometimes he\u2019s playing the piano he has in the upstairs  hall. Sometimes he puts on a record and dances like no one\u2019s watching, even though someone is  watching. But anything to do with normal human functions? Eating, drinking, going to the bathroom?  Nowhere to be found. \n\nWeeks go by. You reach the limit of what can be learned by peaking through windows. So you break  into his house one Saturday morning, throwing a rock through a window and loosening the bolt. You  look into his fridge, and there\u2019s no food, but there are stacks and stacks of bags filled with a dark red  liquid. It\u2019s blood. You look around some more. You realize there\u2019s no mirrors anywhere. \n\nFinally you get  to a closed door upstairs. You push it open and see, pushed up against the wall and resting on a large  block, a coffin. You creep over to it and gently open the lid. Inside is your neighbor, with a trickle of  blood running down his mouth. Up close you can see his two sharp fangs protruding over his lip. It\u2019s  confirmed. Definitely a vampire. Only one thing to do. \n\n You go back downstairs and smash one of the chairs in the kitchen, made from a heavy pine wood.  You\u2019d think the noise would wake someone, but the vampire remained fast asleep. You take one of the legs and, with a knife from the counter, sharpen it to a point. Finally, you grab a meat tenderizer from  one of the drawers and go back upstairs, on to the coffin room. \n\nYou lift the lid, place the stake, and pound down the hammer. Your neighbor wakes up, screams, then  crumbles to dust right there. You did it. You killed the vampire. And it wasn\u2019t even that hard. You go  home, feeling very proud of yourself. \n\nUntil later that night, when the police show up at your house. They say they have a warrant for your  arrest, for breaking into your neighbor\u2019s house and killing him. But, you say, he was a vampire. And the police say yes he was, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can just kill him like that. You\u2019re impressed by how  casually they agreed he was a vampire, but distressed by them believing what you did was murder. \n\nLater, at your trial, you learn that, yes, your neighbor was indeed a vampire. A vampire who sponsored the town\u2019s youth sports league. A vampire who taught adult literacy classes at the local community  college. A vampire who let people use his lawn in the summer for free movie nights. A vampire, in  other words, who cared. And then, the prosecutor says pointing at you, this villain over here broke  into his house, destroyed his furniture, and killed him without mercy. And doesn\u2019t even feel sorry  about it! What crime, the prosecutor asks, did this vampire commit? Was he bothering anyone?  Hurting anyone? Doing anything to deserve a stake through the heart? He. Did. Not.  \n\nYour own lawyer argues that all vampires must drink blood to survive and so he had to have been a  monster.

It began to dash into the forest, with an instinctive knowledge that to run was to live. It smelled of hay and sweat, bringing the Dragoneers to life, as their reptilian thirst for warm blood awakened, and cunning forgotten came to the forefront. The first to run after the boar was Lily, and her face was a sight to see, for calm had morphed into an intense excitement, and she was grinning as she ran, her teeth white and sharp, her body lithe and sleek, what dark scales she had on her back and arms glittering in the dappled moonlight. She had foregone clothing except for a loose loincloth around her hips, and her breasts had almost completely merged into her body, so that they were not in the way. Just one step behind and on the right of the beast her long scaled legs bounded, unhindered by the cold snow and rough thorns. The beast, being blocked from the right which led into a darkly thicketed, safe ravine, ran in mad dashes ahead, sometimes veering in roundabouts around treacherous unseen quicksands and swamps that usurped several Dragoneers, who cried as they fell to the traps of the night, their wounded screams piercing the landscape and sending chills up Tam\u2019s spine. They would never move on.

She suddenly felt that the boar was banking towards the left, where the bush was thicker, and there the prey would be lost soon enough. She had to take a chance. She broke away from the path of the mass of Dragoneers who were performing the role of drivers, and went on her own towards what she predicted would be the boar\u2019s path. She was still uncertain, but she felt something that drove her to make this risk in a lifetime of monotony. No longer would she follow behind. *Awaken*, the voice within her commanded. \n\nShe could smell. See. Feel the boar\u2019s fear, its mind wildly calculating its last escape. The moon, high in the sky; the trees, awash in its light. The good night air, cold and fresh in her lungs.

She\u2019d done it. She was a true Dragoneer. The boar had slashed her across the thigh.

We barricaded the windows by ripping apart the firewood pallets just in case. Alex is usually right, so I\u2019m going to trust him. We left just enough space so we can see out of it, but it\u2019ll be damn hard to get in, that\u2019s for sure. Alex is freaked the fuck out. I don\u2019t know what he thinks he saw but it scared the piss out of him whatever it was. \n\nSome fucking lunatic broke into the house today. He was on bath salts or something, I don\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t even have a weapon, just busted the fucking door down and ran in screaming and started grabbing me. Alex had to shoot him. We called the police to report but the phone line was busy, and I thought I heard someone talking on the other end, but no one answered. Couldn\u2019t drive over there to report it either. Nobody came over or said anything, they had to have heard the shot, the fuck is going on? I don\u2019t think Alex is okay\u2026 I tried thanking him but he seems like he\u2019s in shock. We don\u2019t know what to do with the body. I\u2019ll put it in the basement and try the cops again later.\n\nPhone lines won\u2019t call anywhere, they\u2019re all down. We heard voices coming through. At first I thought I was hearing things, but Alex heard them too. They spoke to us. Not sure what they were saying, but I know they were speaking to us. I felt it. Can\u2019t really describe it. Not touching the phone again. We gotta try the radio. Police have to have the radios still up. That body is starting to smell. \n\nPower went out today. Thankfully we have a backup generator, but it doesn\u2019t cover the whole house - have to conserve the power. Just the living room and the kitchen, Alex and I will sleep on the floor and the couch. I gave Alex the couch. Dudes been through enough. No way he\u2019s sleeping on the floor after what he did for me. Everything is down. Radio won\u2019t connect, tele broadcasts have stopped, phones won\u2019t work. It\u2019s just static. \n\nWent into the basement to bury the body. Couldn\u2019t stand the smell anymore. It\u2019s fucking GONE. I\u2019m freaking out man. Where the fuck did it go? Did Alex move it? Maybe outside? Maybe he couldn\u2019t stand the smell anymore\u2026 I\u2019m afraid to ask him. I don\u2019t want to bring it up, he still hasn\u2019t gotten over it. He\u2019ll barely speak to me, he\u2019s always staring at the walls and listening to the radio, trying to get a signal out. He hasn\u2019t been the same. \n\nShadows. Shadows in the black. Doesn\u2019t make sense but they\u2019re there. Our flashlights can see them, you shine at the wall and the light can\u2019t go through something. Something\u2019s there. I can see them. Can they see me?\n\nAlex lost it. He\u2019s just been staring at the radio, listening to static. He won\u2019t move or respond. When I talk to him he just looks at me, but he doesn\u2019t speak. I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s him. He\u2019s talking to the radio when he thinks I\u2019m out of the room. I think I can hear someone speaking back. I Have to get out of here, but where? \n\nI can hear them. Everywhere, always. They\u2019re in the noise. Can\u2019t use the radio, that\u2019s what they use. Same with the phones. They\u2019re in it. They\u2019re inside. \n\nThe rain. The rain is hiding them. Out the window, I saw shapes where the water wasn\u2019t hitting the ground. They weren\u2019t human. They weren\u2019t me - I\u2019m me, they can\u2019t be me. \n\nAlex locked himself in his room. Won\u2019t let me in, won\u2019t come out. He took the radio with him, all I can hear is static coming from under his door. I\u2019m leaving tomorrow. Gotta tell him, get him to come with me. \n\nSomething took Alex. All I heard was screaming, static, silence. Busted the door down. Blood everywhere, black everywhere, no sign of Alex. The radio is still on but there\u2019s no power to it. I can hear them. They can hear me. They know I\u2019m here, they want me here. They want all of us here, all of us in the darkness. Not me. Getting out of here. I can\u2019t listen to them anymore. Won\u2019t become like the others. \n\nAlex, I\u2019m so sorry.

Navisko.7\n\nEarth 203\n\nYTR 3.50021 (Extra Credit: May 28th 3004)\n\nNote: Per assignment requirement Earth units used.\n\nHumans have been on Earth for about 2 million years. They have lived through three separate extinction events and survived all of them. However, in each event their numbers are reduced drastically, and they do not maintain a bridge of knowledge between the periods. In the current period, they believe their existence is about 200,000 years old. They agree on this number given the information they've found buried in the shallows of Earth's surface.\n\nEarth is currently experiencing an extinction event. As recently as 60 years ago, there were about 11 billion humans on the planet, that number is now down to a few hundred thousand. It will likely contract further in the coming millennia. The current estimates are a stable population of about 80 thousand humans spread across the globe with no clusters no larger than a few hundred.\n\nHow did humans see such a drastic reduction in population in such a short time? There are many factors to this, but the underlying cause was ignorance. Humans saw themselves as disconnected individuals rather than parts of a larger human body. Their choices were limited to how they would be individually impacted. They rarely considered the impact beyond their own lifetime.\n\nThough humans had developed the technology to eliminate the need for wealth disparity, they went in the opposite direction. They used the technology to further the gap between the few and the many. This was not done by mistake, but as a coordinated effort by those few who wanted to keep everything for themselves. What's remarkable is that it worked.\n\nIt's well documented that the only way for the few to rule the many is for the many to adopt the belief system of the few. The view is that everyone is separate from each other. People can work together, but they are fundamentally different. If the many adopt this view, then they become divided and ineffective. The few create arbitrary lines and divide the many into parts, telling them that their experience is the only true one. The many are told the others are responsible for their misery. This lie works because This type of division allows for the few to do as they please, and in the case of humans, the few wanted to separate themselves more.\n\nThe problem is the few failed to see the greater human body, much less the greater Earth body. That larger body was neglected, decaying, and rotting until it finally toppled over.\n\nOnce it was known that Earth was finite, the water shortage should have been easily preventable. The evidence of the impending danger was evident at least 100 years prior to the tipping point. Human society was in such poor health, that even when some of them spoke of the dire situation, they were ignored.\n\nThere are arguments to be made that if humans had decided to focus on water responsibility, they could have significantly reduced their chances of destruction. Afterall, their planet is covered in water, though most of it is high in minerals that humans can't consume. They developed technology to remove the minerals, making the water safe for consumption. Still, with their chosen system of self-focus, it's no surprise that these projects were not widely implemented.\n\nEven if they'd solved the water problem, they still had a major pollution issue which would have kept them on the same course. Human bodies require a constant replenishment of air. Despite this being evident in every human, they did not take care to keep their air optimal for health. As with water, we saw the few prioritizing themselves over the larger human life.\n\nLead is a neurotoxin. It can cause irreparable harm especially in the young. However, some humans were so desperate to be individuals that they lied to each other about the harms of exposure, even though the dangers had been known 2000 years prior. There are countless examples of a few humans deciding they are more important than others and willingly causing them harm.\n\nEven without the toxins, pollution was still a problem. Humans developed many one-time use items which would take thousands of years to decay into useable matter. These items would be placed in landfills where humans buried unwanted items in the dirt. It doesn't take a rocket scientist (extra credit, culture; Human humor), to know that the math doesn't quite work. If something takes a day to use and 30,000 days to become useable material again, then that\u2019s a problem. Again, this demonstrates their fatal flaw; they couldn't see past themselves.\n\nEven without the pollution, humans were consistently engaged in violence and resource competition. They would routinely murder each other to get more than they needed. They would also watch others die so that they could live instead of seeing others' lives as being as valuable as their own. While a few typically benefitted from wars, the many suffered. Still, the many would be the ones killing and fighting despite being the ones to suffer most.\n\nIt feels like beating a dead horse but, this is the result of humans seeing themselves as different from one another. In truth, humans are fundamentally the same. Their differences are the product of environmental factors. If they recognized this, they would have been able to avoid catastrophe.\n\nAfter all, that is the understanding that has been foundational to our longevity. We know that helping each other benefits everyone. There are no downsides to seeing each other as part of the larger body. In that body, every part is equally valued. The problems arise when one part thinks it\u2019s more valuable than another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExtra Credit: Possible Future\n\nGiven that humans have already grown past the population capacity twice, it doesn't seem likely that they'll reach the next stage of evolution. This is unfortunate as Earth is truly a remarkable planet. Maybe it's blind desire more than fact-based, but I still think they have a chance. The number of people waking up to the problems was rapidly increasing prior to the tipping point. The odds are good that the survivors will accept our message and believe us when we explain their intended path of evolution. If the humans understand that we can only provide the means and it's up to them to do the work, then their odds will dramatically increase.\n\nPersonal Note:\n\nProfessor! I got a job on the re-stocking crew! I'm going to be one of the animal caretakers (Woolly Mammoths!!!) and will get to meet some real humans!

Nobody knows what is behind the clouds in the Endless Sky, but those who go looking never come back. A few askissa have been lost to the Endless Sky, most notably Pondrid the Brave. I had the pleasure to interview Ovriul Ashcoat, Pondrid's brother, and write about how he and Pondrid invented the airship and how Pondrid disappeared.\n\nYear 0, right after the Fall of the Known Civilization, Kindling the dragon was flying across the Endless Sky. On her back, an askissa was giving birth. The folk had survived a horrific event, but were now focused on welcoming a cub being born at the worst time possible. After hours of pain and labor, a little cub emerged into the world, letting everyone know he was a survivor by meowing loudly. His mother held him close to her chest and whispered his name, Pondrid, to him. After giving her son his name, she passed away. Mrs. Ashcoat, another pregnant askissa, volunteered to adopt Pondrid and raise him as her own with her husband. When the dragon landed in Kindling and the folk began to rebuild their lives, Mrs. Ashcoat gave birth to her own cub, Ovriul.\n\nTaking care of two cubs was often difficult, but the Ashcoats managed fine with the help from the folk. The cubs brought new hope for everyone, as it reminded them how life goes on and how they must endure for the future generations. Pondrid and Ovriul became inseparable as they grew older. Their father encouraged the pair to be curious of the world around them and would often take the cubs to work with him. As soon as Ovriul could hold tools in his little paws, he and Pondrid would try to build their own inventions. Pondrid was the more creative one and came up with the ideas, while the more technically gifted Ovriul would do the building. The pair's inventions often ended up not working or were too bizarre or inconvenient, but their parents kept encouraging them to keep inventing.\n\nOne night, the brothers were gazing off into the Endless Sky. Pondrid told Ovriul how he wanted to explore the Endless Sky and find what was beyond it. In his mind, since he was born there, he was the one destined to unlock its secrets. Ovriul tried to talk his brother out of his crazy idea, but Pondrid had made up his mind. Ovriul worried that Pondrid would jump off into the Endless Sky and began to think ways to keep his brother safe.\n\nOn Kindling's Day, the folk in the kingdom celebrated the dragon that brought them to the new land and remembered those who perished in the Fall of the Known Civilization. The folk would make paper lanterns with directions attached to them and release them into the Endless Sky in the hopes of a lantern reaching a lost askissa and bringing them home. Pondrid always attached a note addressed to his mother on his lantern in hopes of her still being alive and coming back to him. As the lanterns drifted away and Ovriul watched them float higher into the sky, he had an idea.\n\nThe following morning Ovriul jumped out of bed and ran into his workshop. He frantically gathered all the tools and materials and began to work on his new invention, the airship. In the evening, Pondrid came to look for his brother, who was so immersed in his work that he had missed dinner. Ovriul was disappointed that Pondrid saw the airship before it was finished, but his disappointment vanished when Pondrid expressed his wonder with the new invention and practically begged to help build it. The pair finished the airship together, naming it \"The Explorer.\" The Ashcoats were surprised with the airship and expressed concern over whether it would work and if it could be dangerous. Pondrid managed to convince them that they would be careful and not fly too high.\n\nA rumor had began to circle about the airship and when the day of the test flight came, Ovriul and Pondrid saw the curious folk gathered outside the workshop. Pondrid explained to the crowd how the airship worked, as Ovriul prepared for the flight. The folk watched in awe the airship slowly lifting off. It climbed swiftly, quickly reaching the rooftops of the surrounding houses. The pair flew the airship across the kingdom, the folk below them looking in amazement. They flew past the Royal Palace and waved to the Royal Family. They returned back to their workshop to find the crowd had grown and were cheering. Ovriul carefully landed the airship and disembarked with Pondrid to face the excited crowd. The Ashcoats eventually had to call for the Royal Guard to send the folk home, so the boys could eat and go to bed, instead of answering the endless questions the folk had for them.\n\nAt midnight, Pondrid and Ovriul got out of their beds and sneaked into the workshop to take the airship out. Ovriul brushed his paw over the airship's nameplate. Pondrid hopped on board the ship and began to prepare for his flight. Ovriul handed him his bag, filled with food and warm blankets. The two brothers looked at each other for a while before hugging tightly. The airship gracefully lifted off and Ovriul was left to watch his brother float away into the unknown. A single tear rolled down his cheek.\n\nThe Ashcoats woke up in the morning and found Ovriul crying in the empty workshop. He confessed to his parents that he had built the airship specifically for Pondrid to go and explore the Endless Sky. His mother collapsed to the ground in tears and his father ran outside to try and catch a glimpse of Pondrid. He notified the passing guards about Pondrid and soon the story began to spread. King Godrid Flameheart ordered his guard to fly with the dragon and search for the boy in the neighboring islands. Only one other island was inhabited during this time, the Children of the Moon had been exiled to an empty island and established the Free City of Moonfall, they promised to look around and send word if they saw anything. Kindling the dragon flew around the islands for days, but nobody ever saw Pondrid or The Explorer again.\n\nOn every Kindling's Day until their deaths, the Ashcoats attached notes to their lanterns addressed to Pondrid, telling him how he could always come back home if he wanted to and released them with the hope of him returning. Ovriul constructed more airships and started a business ferrying goods and folk between Kindling and Moonfall. As more islands became inhabited, his business grew. The Ashcoat Company is still operating the airships, transporting thousands of folk between the cities everyday. Pondrid's story became a cautionary tale and he was mockingly given the moniker \"the Brave.\" It is often forgotten how he was a loved son and a brother, and how his disappearance left a hole in his family, or what an important role he played in the invention of the airship that revolutionized the kingdom.\n\nI truly hope Pondrid Ashcoat found peace in the Endless Sky and may he be reunited with his mother.\n\nBased on an interview with Ovriul Ashcoat  \nMierza Forguard, the librarian  \nYear 30, Moonfall", "ups": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.79}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "But I\u2019m Sore, I\u2019m Sorry", "text": " \n\nSometimes I thought about cutting myself open.

I cried so hard, and I tried to breathe, I really did, but nothing came in. Everything poured out. I couldn\u2019t stand myself weeping, not even having the decency to just cry. I couldn\u2019t. I won\u2019t ever feel like this, I can\u2019t. As I sat outside on the porch listening to my dad strategizing to gain my love, I felt it.

You can call him such, but a plethora of other names will do just as well: a writer, a storyteller, a bard, a musician. He traveled across the world gathering stories, recording them with his pen and voice and a variety of other means. He spoke of dragons in the clouds and fire smoldering under the earth, of people together and people apart.\n\nAnother truth.\n\nHowever, as stories are told and retold and spread, their edges warp and become unlike the original.

It meant a destiny grand in its expanse, a story that would awe the entire world.\n\nIt became hope. This, at least, is true, even if the legends surrounding it are not.\n\nPerhaps the sword truly is magic, awaiting a savior to herald a golden age. Perhaps it was simply the marker of a grave for a fallen friend. Perhaps it held no true significance at all, lost or abandoned by one who did not want it.\n\nIt is impossible, I think, for anyone to ever know for certain. When you tell this story, you may decide what it is, or perhaps what it isn't, or if it even exists at all.\n\nPerhaps the stories the people tell about the sword are false. Perhaps they are true.\n\nPerhaps it doesn't matter at all.\n\nPerhaps what truly matters about this sword is not what it was, but what it became.\n\nr/StoriesOfAshes for more of my writing!

Everyone in your family does, actually. Someone dropped them off earlier in the morning, saying these donkeys are now yours, courtesy of the government, and left before anyone could say anything. So now there\u2019s all these donkeys in the house. They start running around, breaking furniture and generally making a mess of the place. They calm down a few minutes later, but you\u2019re all still wondering what exactly you\u2019re going to do with all these donkeys, and why the government gave them to you in the first place.\n\nSomeone turns on the news, which was seldom followed in this house, and hears the president explain that the donkeys will be good for the economy. And the president is asked how by a reporter, to which he replies that the donkeys will operationalize sovereign revenue via targeted reimbursements vis a vis the dynamic variable class commodity types available on even-numbered days. To which the response, from both the reporter and the family, is \u2018huh.\u2019\n\nThe president says that is why every man, woman and child in this country will receive one free donkey a week, every week, for life. That, he says, is our promise to this nation.\n\nHe adds, too, that you are not allowed to sell them, kill them, or otherwise get rid of them. Trying to do any of these things will result in severe punishment. And on that note, the news turns to the weather. Sure enough, a week passes, and more donkeys arrive. You lead them out to your yard, where your family has set up a small pen for the others. Already you can tell it\u2019s starting to get crowded.\n\nAnother week passes. When the next batch of donkeys arrive, you beg and plead to send them back, that your family cannot possibly take any more, you just don\u2019t have the room, but you are told gruffly that it\u2019s for your own good, and to trust them. He leaves you with the new donkeys.\n\nMore weeks pass. The donkeys in the yard are crammed shoulder to shoulder, barely able to move.People are protesting in the streets by the millions. The cry is loud and clear, from coast to coast, 'no more donkeys!\u2019 The president addresses the nation, saying that their demands have been heard, but the economy needs donkeys, as many donkeys as possible, or else the entire system will crash, and so the program must continue.\n\nYour heart sinks when you realize it\u2019s only a year into the term.\n\nTime goes by. The donkeys keep coming. At this point your family has moved to the countryside,where they could roam and get some space. The problem is everyone else had that same idea. As a result, what should have been a spacious and relaxing dwelling, where the donkeys stay outdoors, becomes a dense, crowded hive of hee-haws and brays that stretch on for miles. The only thing giving you hope is that the president is extremely unpopular because of the donkey program.\n\nSomeone else, anyone else, would surely be better, right?\n\nOver the months, there\u2019s eventually just two candidates left in the primary to face the president. One is a senator who says the donkey program must end immediately, and people should have the right to get rid of their donkeys and live a donkey-free existence. And the other is a governor who says the president\u2019s got it all wrong because what should really be sent to people, once a week, every week, for life, is wolverines. Wolverines will both solve the donkey problem as well as revive the flagging wolverine breeding industry. You have absolutely no idea why, but somehow, someway, this is who wins.\n\nNow it\u2019s the person who sends you a donkey every week against the person who thinks you should be getting a wolverine every week instead. You watch the world argue furiously over what animal is better to have hundreds of at a time. You, yourself, are torn, but if you had to choose you\u2019d rather switch to wolverines because they\u2019re smaller and easier to isolate. You\u2019re in luck,  because that\u2019s who wins. And now instead of a yard full of donkeys, your family\u2019s got a closet of wolverines.\n\nThis, you think, is progress", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.79}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "Scared of Nothing ", "text": "When I was a kid I had a monster at the end of my bed.

A horrible, ominous mass of nothing, looming in the dark.\nSome nights the nothing would touch me. Those nights were the worst. I would be engulfed by a feeling like coldness. It wasn\u2019t cold though, wasn\u2019t anything really, but it was like cold, like the idea of cold. I know that doesn\u2019t quite make sense, but that\u2019s what it felt like.\nWhen the nothing got too near it was overwhelming. I could feel it pressing down on my chest, making it almost impossible to breathe. The nothing would loom over me, an inch away from my face, too close.\nIt didn\u2019t have any recognisable features, wasn\u2019t anything close to human. It was just a mass of nothing at all. A big, gaping absence.\n\nI can still remember that exact feeling, being a small child paralysed by fear. An indescribable terror, of nothing. Nothing physical, nothing real, nothing I could explain.\nBut, like all kids and their monsters, I grew out of it. The nothing stopped appearing at the end of my bed, and eventually I thought about it so little I almost forgot about it entirely. Now I had proper adult things to worry about like taxes and climate change.\n\nI was about 24 when I noticed it again. It wasn\u2019t the same as before, but still, i recognised it. My nothing.\nIt came back so gradually I didn\u2019t even realise it was there for so long. I was at work, sat at my desk, trying to focus and refocus and focus again on something deeply meaningless. I felt something like coldness. Not cold, but something close. Time shifted, I couldn\u2019t tell if it had sped up or slowed almost to a halt, but it had changed. The wave of nothing slowly abated, but I don\u2019t know if it ever went away entirely.\n\nIt came back again the next week. I had been walking to the station. The wind hit my cheek, but I didn\u2019t feel it. Or I did? But not as much somehow. It was as if I knew the wind was on my face, but I knew it in a different time, or a different place. My walking became somebody else's. Somebody I was watching. Like playing a game, I was controlling a character, I knew it was mine, but somehow it wasn\u2019t me.\nOver time the nothing engulfed me. It filled my body, compressing me into the centre of myself. I no longer touched the edges. Everything I saw, felt or did was through a thick membrane of nothing. \n\nIt began replacing parts of me, displacing them with absence. Like a parasite. It ate parts of my memory, I would lose names, whole people and moments of my own history. It took my joy, and my sadness too. It was totally indiscriminate.\nI was small, inside myself, and everything was so hard. I fought so hard to even exist.\n\nI was fighting nothing, there was nothing there.

So new, so volatile, so underdeveloped. \n\nI have spent my training dedicated to the songs of the Haphstations, the light shows of the Nexlar, the stealthy games of Velith, all eons of journeys old, all established, all fascinating in their patterns, and steady rhythms in harmony with the universe, with order. \n\nHundreds of journeys spent in the temples of our worlds, studying, seeking the patterns, seeking the comfort of repetition and harmony. \u201cSteady and well-paced.\u201d That is what I am known for, that is the epitome of our order.

The rest of my peers commended my actions as a necessary step.

Ha! \n\nAnd yet, here I am, Earth. This chaotic, unbound, unbridled, violent, overpopulated planet. Of all the trillions of worlds we have chosen to observe, there are few so stuffed full of species, so much; variety, so little space. Why this speck was ever added to our chosen is beyond me. It must have something to do with the one who found it. \n\n*Reminder;* check the melodies for who found Earth and which Curators thought it wise to add it to our chosen.

These Lower Curators are our mentors, our guides during our first steps into Observation, they cannot be allowed to wander from The Harmonies.

Here it is. Give feedback please. =)\n\n\nWhen the Others came to Earth we were unprepared. There were no procedures for first contact, no contingencies in place, no plans whatsoever. They came, and we were simply not ready. The militaries of all the world's major powers scrambled to form some sort of defense, provide some semblance of security to the panicking masses that took to the streets to see the object commonly called the 'mothership'. In truth, the object, whose length was estimated at the time to be roughly fifty miles, or, more exactly, eighty-two thousand meters, was little more than a landing shuttle. The Others' real mothership, a vessel larger than the Earth's moon, remained safely hidden in the darkness of space. Out of sight, out of mind, for most anyway. \n\nThe Others made no attempt to contact humanity. No little green men demanded to be taken to our leaders. No invaders threatened our cities. No one was abducted, or killed, or experimented on. That was the most frightening part of the experience. The mothership entered our atmosphere silently and settled into perfect stillness over the Atlantic. Then\u2026 then it just floated there. \n\nPeople panicked. There was rioting, looting. Many people tried to flee the cities and hide out in the countryside. Others just sat in their homes, their eyes glued to the news, watching as the Others seemed to do nothing at all, day after day.\n\nThe first communication attempt was made by a joint mission by the United Nations, headed by a science and linguistics staff assembled from the world's best and brightest minds. A ship was launched from New York city and set sail toward the mothership's location. It did not make it. It simply disappeared without any trace a short while after its last transmission, which stated that the Others seemed to be trying to communicate with something below the ocean's surface. \n\nThe next mission was led by the Americans. A group of helicopters was meant to attempt a landing aboard the Others' vessel and establish contact. This mission too, simply vanished from radar after reporting strange radio signals. \n\nThere was nothing else that could be done. A military assault seemed futile at best, and self-destructive at worst. The Others were making no threats, no demands, and, from a distance at least, seemed to be doing nothing at all. \n\nAfter three weeks, the mothership moved. A deep rumble emanated from it, or as some speculate, from below it. The sound was so powerful that it was heard around the world and generated tsunami sized waves that traveled to all coasts around the Atlantic. Then, the vessel floated up and out of the Earth's atmosphere as silently as it had come. The true mothership remained in orbit for a few days, but it too vanished shortly after these events. The lost teams were found, some time later, back aboard the ship that had sailed from New York with no memory of ever having left their homes. No recordings or data seem to have ever been collected.\n\nTo this day, the xeno-scientific community is unsure of what the purpose of the Others' visit was. Some say that they were here to determine whether earth was viable for colonization. Others think that they were simply prospecting for valuable resources. Still others believe that they had taken the vanished mission teams as test subjects for some sick experiments before wiping their minds and returning them. There are a few that have another theory, though. They think that the Others were here to wake something\u2026 something that had been lying dormant beneath the sea.

From the murky green fog it came, 'The Monster' had finally come for him.

All that we've made, all that made us great, vanished in the nuclear blasts, and what survived withered away in the wasteland. We could do better.

The entire chamber went silent. Few knew what he really was asking about.\n\n\u201cOur scouts that we have keeping an eye on them report they have defeated a troll mountain,\u201d she answered.\n\n\u201cJust a mountain troll?\u201d one of the officers scoffed.\n\n\u201cNo General, a Troll Mountain. As in a troll that has grown to the size of a mountain,\u201d she clarified. The General went very pale at the idea.\n\n\u201cWhere was it?\u201d another asked.\n\n\u201cThe Dune Sea, apparently it was hidden under a massive set of dunes and recently awoke.

It was a map of the world with notes on each of the Heroes party\u2019s exploits.\n\nIf anyone else saw this, they\u2019d just think he was keeping track of a genuine threat. But the people in this room all knew he was just a dumb doting dad.\n\n\u201cThat makes this her seventh disaster class monster to date!\u201d he said, pinning a new note to the map.\n\n\u201cActually, boss, that'll be her eighth. They apparently fought an elder dragon as they were sailing over to the Dune Sea,\u201d Heek said.\n\n\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t this reported?!\u201d he boomed, turning to face the room.\n\n\u201cWell, sir, it was a private sailing ship they bought themselves. Also, I only received word of it this morning through our messenger system. I was going to pass it to you later,\u201d Heek explained.\n\n\u201cEven better!!\u201d he beamed, adding an extra pin into the Straight of Balthazar.\n\n\u201cMaster, I hope when the day comes where you will stand on opposite sides, you will take the good of the nation into consideration,\u201d Vestari said.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Helshep uttered, confused. \u201cSorry I wasn\u2019t listening. What was that Vestari?\u201d he said, turning and actually paying attention to his Vizier.\n\n\u201cI said will you fight her if you have to?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOf course, I will. She is my pride and joy. But she still needs to learn which opponents she should face. I won\u2019t kill her, just a friendly parental beat down,\u201d he said. The crowd were visibly reassured.\n\nThey often worried about him when it came to his family. As in regards to both his adopted children and his children by blood, he often lost all sense of logic and became an uncontrollable storm.\n\n\u201cYou know, looking back when I first met her, I knew she had to be your kid Boss,\u201d Silvers said.\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Helshep said, turning suspiciously towards him.\n\n\u201cYes, Boss, I didn\u2019t think meeting a fifteen-year-old would make me near wet my breeches.

While they were lost in their revelry, a knock came at the door. The officers had returned from their break and were ready to resume.\n\n\u201cHey Alex, get your face back on,\u201d Yuu said, jabbing his ribs with her elbow. His face returned to his stern political stone-faced shape with a few slaps.\n\n\u201cEnter!\u201d his voice boomed, returning to its emotionless state.

Hearing the songs of her companions. Feeling so full of life and bustling with energy.\n\nAnd time passed.\n\nAs the bird flew, the leaves changed their colors, and the skies clouded over. There was a briskness in the air that hadn't been there before. And still, the bird took to the skies every chance she could. She dipped among the many-colored leaves and gloried as they fluttered around her, falling to the ground. She smelled the distant scent of smoke and saw the fruits and vegetables ripen and be harvested.\n\nSoon, the trees had lost all their leaves leaving their branches bare. The sun hid behind the ever-present clouds and the sky was dark. The snow fell. Lightly at first, then with greater urgency. The snow piled around the base of the tress, muffling the sounds of the forest. Hiding the beauty under a blanket of white.\n\nThe chill air hurt the bird as she flew through it. The deep breaths that had brought her the summer-fresh breezes and the crisp autumn winds took a cruel turn. The coldness if the wind bit into her skin as she continued her flight. Her heart became as heavy as the sky now. The efforts it took to flap her wings and lift herself into the sky made her very bones ache.\n\nBut on she flew. With an ache in her bones and a chill through to her skin. On she flew.\n\nUntil, one day, she just\u2026 couldn\u2019t. The bird landed.

Man found a way to hurt them too. Each time a child is born a fairy\u2019s innocence is taken from them and given to the child, leaving the fairy repulsive and weak. Because of this, the fairies no longer have childhoods. Where they once flew with butterflies and birds they now sleep. Plucked of their innocence they were weak and filled with rage. \n\nOn the other hand, human children flourished, living out their innocence for 18 long years. They have a childhood and innocence that does not belong to them. Once mother nature learned that man has yet again taken this from her too, she was distraught, enraged, furious.\n\nShe focused all of her energy on the fairies she made them strong, and no longer weak. When they were healthy again and awake, they took back what was once theirs. They would expose the human\u2019s young to treacherous things. Their innocence left them sooner than the 18 years it was supposed to. The fairies relished in this. They were vengeful.\n\nWhile the fairies' children were dying, the humans were living. So their fairy\u2019s created basterds, thieves, murderers, wars, in the hopes of getting rid of this pest. The fairies hoped that by doing so the humans would do what they\u2019ve always done; kill each other.\n\nIt worked. The humans waged war on each other killing themselves over and over again.

Some worlds had more advanced creatures capable of communication, rudimentary forms of civilization, and mechanization. But this planet, this one was very different.\n\nEven before they had approached the planet they were receiving electromagnetic impulses radiating from it. The impulses were far stronger than anything that could have been occurring naturally. The Captain plotted a course to slip in behind a moon that was orbiting this planet. He was going to approach the planet very cautiously. His ship was of the most advanced series available when he and his partner left on their voyage of discovery. It had the ability to deflect energy around it, and thus be invisible to most scanning or tracking attempts. He engaged the machinery to ensure their presence was not noticed if by some unthinkable chance the planet was inhabited by an advanced species of beings.\n\nThe Captain and his partner spent some time as they hid behind the planet\u2019s moon analyzing the data they had collected as they approached the planet. The planet seemed to be an excellent habitat for carbon-based lifeforms. The planet enjoyed a very stable orbit around its star. The presence of the sizable moon they were hiding behind caused tidal forces on the planet\u2019s surface to circulate the sizable collection of water present on the surface. Analysis of the surface and sub-surface data collected showed an abundant supply of minerals necessary for any advanced civilization.\n\nThe Captain and his partner finished their work with all the data they had. The Captain decided it was time to swing into an orbit around the planet and continue their studies. As they settled into an orbit just above the planet\u2019s atmosphere, they began to collect and analyze the enormous amount of electromagnetic radiation being generated on the planet\u2019s surface. As the Captain looked through the analyses of the data, a strange thought began to form in his mind. \u201cIs this their form of communication,\u201d he wondered. He had read of ancient uses of electromagnetic communications, but that technology had died out long ago.\n\nAs he studied the data he saw patterns emerging. Some of the EMC was scattered in all directions from single points. Apparently, the message was intended to be received by anyone with an appropriate device. Some EMC was directed from point to point, apparently in an attempt to control access to the message. His analysis led him to understand that the beings on this planet had multiple modes of communication. Decoding some of the signals his machinery intercepted enabled him to see that the transmission of images was a big part of their communications. The transmissions had images of the beings interacting with each other, some images of what appeared to be their written languages, and also some images of lesser creatures these beings appeared to enjoy interacting with.\n\nThe Captain was troubled by one aspect of the analysis. After allocating some of the signal to the images, some of it to simply being the medium by which the message flowed, and allowing for other technical matters, there was one channel of data being transmitted he could not crack. He broadened his search and expanded the signals the machinery would intercept. He soon found not only streams with image channels and the mystery channel, but he also found points of transmission of nothing but the mystery material. These transmissions had no images, just the data stream he could not crack. Perplexed, he brought his partner into the work of understanding this mystery. With a fresh perspective on the matter, she asked herself if there was any correlation between the image data and the mystery data. She watched the images produced by the data streams. The beings took many forms, engaged in a huge variety of activities, and she began to notice patterns between their movements and the mystery data stream.\n\nSometimes the mystery data signal would generate a reaction that caused great excitement. Sometimes the mystery data signal generated what appeared to be a state of peace in the beings. As she worked with the machinery interpreting the EMC received from the surface she pondered the conversions her machines were making. The very high frequency signals created the images. The ultra-high frequency signals created other styles of communications. Hidden in the mystery stream were very low frequency signals. Signal frequencies too low to be played on the imaging machines. She isolated the very low frequency signals and watched the reactions of the beings when exposed to the signals. Some seemed happy, some sad. She found some visual image streams where large numbers of the beings would gather, and soon the mystery data stream would show huge patterns of activity. She had to devise a way to convert the the mystery data signal to something she could experience. She and the Captain had watched huge amounts of images. The machinery was very adept at transforming the signals into a format their eyes could process. She needed to convert the mystery data signal into something she could feel. She ran the problem through the computer, and it presented an answer. She routed the mystery data signal through the power supply of a small vibrator used to process samples of soil and other solid material. The varying frequencies of the signal would cause the vibrator to change its vibratory pattern to match the signal. She could touch the machine and feel the patterns as the signals went through it. She turned the little machine on and put the signal through it. As she laid her hand on the machine, she felt a soothing pattern of vibrations. Falling and rising in intensity and strength, it seemed to communicate something. She had never felt something like this before. The vibrations seemed to touch her deeply. She began to understand how this phenomenon could have such an impact on the beings of this planet. As she sat there enjoying the vibrations, speculating what they could be communicating to the beings of the planet, she put two more of her hands on the vibrating machine. The Captain walked into the room, surprised to see the blissful look on her face. He walked over and touched the machine, surprised to feel the vibrations. He could understand why she seemed to be enjoying whatever she was experiencing. The vibrator was a poor loud speaker, but it was a very suitable device for the Captain and his partner to experience the phenomenon. As they stood there transfixed by this new strange phenomenon, the mystery signal filled the room, \u201cO come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant\u2026\u2026\u2026..", "ups": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9}, {"genre": "Realistic Fiction", "title": "Home for the Holidays", "text": "## Home for the Holidays\n\nSnow crunched beneath my feet as I walked through the streets of my old neighborhood, my mother\u2019s words from earlier that evening echoing in my head: *If you\u2019re not my son, and you\u2019re not my daughter, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing in my house.*\n\nThe Christmas lights, cheap, tacky, and beautiful, seemed to wonder the same thing. \u201cGo back to the city,\u201d they blinked on and off, never in-between. \u201cChange isn\u2019t welcome here.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t changed,\u201d I wanted to say. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d But it was too cold to stop and argue.

I\u2019d grown up with the owner\u2019s daughter, Jess, and we\u2019d spent a lot of time in that diner. But that was six years and a gender ago; Maggie wasn\u2019t likely to recognize me like this \u2013 not a man, but certainly not the girl her daughter used to hang out with, either.\n\nA bell on the door jingled the same familiar greeting as I entered the diner, which was empty save a few homeless people at the counter. It was Maggie\u2019s tradition to stay open on Christmas Eve, even though few paying customers came in, and to give the homeless a hot meal and an escape from the cold.\n\nA familiar voice caught me by surprise. \u201cHello, stranger, what brings you here?\u201d\n\nI turned to a smiling Jess who, besides the uniform, barely seemed to have changed, herself. *Strangers, is it, now?* \u201cI\u2019m just passing through.

Take a seat, and how \u2019bout I get you some hot cocoa?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds perfect,\u201d I said, taking a seat and picking up a menu so shiny it could have been a mirror. *Finally, something different*, I thought, but as I looked it over, I realized that despite the new look, it hadn\u2019t changed, either.\n\nJess returned a few minutes later with the hot chocolate, topped with toasted marshmallows just the way I remembered. Something, at last, to bring a smile to my face.\n\n\u201cDo you see anything you like?\u201d she asked.\n\n*I like you, Jess. I always have. But you wouldn\u2019t like me if you knew who I was.* \u201cI\u2019ll have the turkey dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cComin\u2019 right up,\u201d she said, then flitted off.\n\nJust as I was enjoying the silence, the jukebox started up \u2013 *All I Want For Christmas Is You.* As far as Christmas songs go, not bad, but I was hardly in the mood.\n\nJess returned and sat down at my table, in the booth opposite me, with a hot chocolate of her own. \u201cSo, where do you call home?\u201d She hadn\u2019t changed a bit \u2013 as forward as ever.\n\n\"I live in San Francisco.\"\n\n\u201cSan Francisco?

To get away from here.* \u201cI guess I felt I\u2019d fit in better. In a big city, I mean.\u201d\n\nJess nodded. \u201cI know what you mean.

The chilly breeze ripples the water as I stand in the dampened sand looking at your memorial.  The flowers and teddy bears that mobbed your smiling picture aren\u2019t nearly as abundant as they were three years ago.  Remnants of shriveled carnations lay at the base of the picture frame.  I see your father bring one every time he trudges down the hill to visit you.  It gets harder for him every time he comes here.\n\nYes, it's a beautiful day today.  Serene.

The traffic thinned out, the bustling strip disappeared in the rear-view and tears began to form in your eyes.  \n\nBy the time we got to the room you were crying, telling me you were ready to leave.

Silence and time, when even the smallest scuff could be a booming signal, but risk for speed was a necessity. Pulling the hood of their cloak closer to their face for coverage, the figure refocused on the arrival. \n\nIn a short dark alley, the figure knocked on a plain wooden door. In a hushed voice, barely perceptible, she whispered, \u201cMaggie?\u201d  In response, on well oiled hinges, the door opened quickly and silently.  The figure was reminded of her previously looming thoughts on silence and time.  She stepped inside and the door closed firmly without a sound.\n\nOnce inside, the figure dropped her hood and a mass of wiry, straw-like, fiery hair humbled out in disarray.  This was one of the many things Fluxx had inherited from her Da, a dwarf.  Others being her pale skin, stubborn and often abrupt nature, and distaste for conventional niceties.  From her mother, a fire genie, she\u2019d acquired her fierce confidence, obsession with magic, and her tendency to spark - both literal and figurative.  Just one of the many reasons she\u2019d been banned from her precious books in the city library and archive. Exactly where she now stood, in the dead quiet of night.  Nothing boils the scholars more than scorched books and scrolls.\n\nMagdalena, her first and only real friend, was the only scholar that understood her passion for knowledge and the side-effects that could come from heightened emotions.  Maggie, as Fluxx affectionately called her, didn\u2019t agree with the edict that banned Fluxx from the archives, and often took the closing shift to assist in after-hours infiltration.  The closing shift wasn\u2019t something often wanted, so the upper scholars were happy to oblige.\n\n Fluxx removed her cloak as she made her way to one of the small sitting areas.  She grabbed the nearest book, *The Ember in the Eye*, the nearest chair, and began absorbing what she could with her limited time.  Page after page, she devoured the information. Page after page, she lost time and place. She clutched the book to her and leaned in, as if in doing so, she could take it all in quicker. Then, rather abruptly, she was ripped out of her reverie by a strand of hair.\n\nWhite hair, just a strand, was draped across the words on the page.\n\nThat singular strand was just distracting enough to have pulled her out of her state.  How odd to so easily be pulled away from such an episode, but also fortuitous to have happened before any damage.  Magdalena usually kept an eye on her, but she was nowhere to be found. Probably finishing up any number of her remaining required duties.  Fluxx relaxed slightly her grip on the book, plucked at the strand, and dropped it to the side of her.  Rubbing her fingertips together to ease the tingling accumulating in them from her magic, she began to dive back into the words scrawled across the page.\n\nA small breeze picked up and blew the strand of hair back into place.\n\nTo Fluxx, that thin strand of hair was as wide as an inlet, distracting - nay, preventing her - from viewing her precious words.  She flung the strand aside, only to have it reappear with another small breeze.  Small breeze?  Fluxx looked up and around her. She was still sitting in the library - an indoor, closed-windowed archive.  Where could that wind shift have come from?  Fluxx pulled on the hair, as if to sever it from whence it came.\n\nThe strand would not break.\n\nhe followed it with her gaze, intent on finding the source.  It trailed from her book to another on the shelf, *Abyss of Destiny*.  Fluxx stood and retrieved that tome from the shelf.  When she opened it and pulled on the hair, once more it would not detach, but led her to another text, *City of Smoke*, higher up.  Her obsession with the strand grew.  Fetching a ladder quickly, she traced the hair through book after book, carelessly ripping the tomes off the shelf and tossing them aside.\n\n*The Immortal Binds.*\n\n*The Call of Silence.*\n\n*The Tangled Throne.*\n\n*The Splintered Strand.*\n\nTome after tome fell to the floor as more and more strands appeared.  She pulled at them, twisted them, tried with everything she had to break them, but to no avail.  The white hair was cascading through the books, tumbling tumultuous through her psyche.  Fluxx was raw and exposed, her frustration and magic growing.  Near the top, leaning precariously to one side, she reached for another tome, *The Voice of the Original*.\n\nBehind the book was a burning, glowing red eye, seeing Fluxx through strands of draping white hair.  In a tone that was booming but ever quiet, she heard a voice say, \u201cYou\u2019ve followed the tangled strands to the root.  You are worthy to separate, cut, make right the wrongs of Men and Gods.

I suppose it made sense, a vision of tidings to come. Mud; it splashed in our boots, wet our clothes, made hands slippery, caked and coated armor. We marched to bring forth a downpour of our own design, a wash with which we would stain the earth this night.   \n\nExhausted, he lurched forth, disenchanted and disturbed with the knowledge of what he must do in the hours ahead. He always felt tired before a fight, drained, as if his mind felt the weight of what is to come before his body. Or was it fear? no, not fear, he was no coward, he had seen fear before and what it does to men. That wasn't what he felt now; he wasn't looking for an escape, for a way out; he was simply consumed by an acute awareness of the challenge ahead. Every warrior carries a beast within; and a wise monster knows to rest before rising to play its game. \n\nHe was comforted at that notion, a hungry creature that craved the fruits that he detested. Thirsting for blood beneath his flesh, gripping the handle of his blade for him.\n\nThere was no bloodlust in his heart, no desire for killing, plunder, or savagery. Yet it wasn't his intention to end up the product of someone else's. For this he was grateful, he thanked the monster. It helped him to imagine there was someone else swinging the blade... some-thing else. Something else's feet marching into the fold, bleeding from his wounds, something else spitting and pissing and pissing at the mulched remains of the ones who dared stand before him. Yes, reveling in the spilt blood wasn't his pleasure; but then why did it happen. \n\nIt was hard to recall, the more he thought about it, the lapses. A moment of preparation, the seething, the chill in his spine and then, nothing; nothing, besides a forward march across piles of dripping mass that could be vaguely described as once human. Clumps of bone and blood mashed together like a clay sculpture; an art critique may call it avant-garde, hailed as a masterpiece for challenging contemporary taste. \n\nBut he was no artist, but not a killer either; at least he didn't feel like one, or didn't wish to. However, no matter how cleverly one sneaks upon a mirror, it will always look you dead in the eye. The lens through which we see ourselves is cloudy, misinterpreted, and filled with lies. Who we really are can only be seen by a vantage point, to which we, unfortunately can never deceive. \n\n\"I am a soldier\" he told himself, \"And a soldier does as he's commanded, there's no pleasure, and no wrong in it.\" \n\nWhy then the guilt, the shame; why did it feel so good to take life? When his blade spilt blood it seemed to fill the pit inside him; and it was intoxicating, satisfying in ways that he desperately wanted his ordinary life to be. In truth it was pale, colorless to cast his net and reel in his provisions day to day. The sound of his children's laughter and the passion in his beloved's eyes; these were paltry reprieves in an otherwise tedious and unsatisfactory life.\n\nPerhaps it was more than a metaphor, more than something he told himself to steel before battle. There was a demon inside him, calling; a voice from a cold, empty place. A place that peacetime could not fill; not with joy or pleasure, not laughter or love. These were deep stony halls, laden with the corpses of fallen adversaries; feed for the pacing beast roaming inside. It terrified him to realize it, to shatter the fa\u00e7ade he saw in himself.

Johansson shipbreaking was not the only facility of its type, but it was certainly the largest. The entire surface of the moon was a massive graveyard for space faring vessels of all kinds. Every ship from RMC freight haulers to UN Destroyers to CMF mobile foundries all found themselves at Deimos at the end of their life. Their first stop was in orbit, where UN observers watched as any weapon systems and the ship's interstellar drive, if installed, was carefully removed. These systems were then packed and loaded onto UN military vessels for transportation to military shipyards. Once the ship was decommissioned it became the property of the Johansson shipbreaking company and was scheduled for deconstruction. \n\nThe first group of shipbreakers aboard were always bulk fluid specialists, or waterboys, as they were commonly known, their dark blue EP suits were easy to spot against the surface. Once they arrived in orbit they drained and purged all ship systems of any liquids, from the potable water in the mess halls, to the nitrogen in the fire suppression systems, to the hydrogen isotopes in the reactor. Once extracted all the fluids are shipped back down to Deimos, where it is stored and eventually resold. Times needed to hit on time bonuses for the waterboys ranged anywhere from one standard day to four standard weeks, depending on the ship's class and tonnage. \n\nUp next were general shipbreakers, who were not granted a nickname until they became a specialist. They wore standard issue fluorescent orange EP suits. They simply and quickly cut the reactor out of the ship's hull using plasma cutters and tethers. There were no on time bonuses for this task as it could be completed by a crew of four in less than six standard hours. It was generally considered a shit job that nobody wanted to do. Once removed the reactor was classified and resold to shipyards. \n\nThe third group of shipbreakers were the electrical systems specialists, clad in yellow EP suits and known as narrowbacks. This group would squeeze into the space inbetween the ships hulls and under a ships grated floors and remove as much of the electrical wiring and batteries they could find in four standard weeks. This group\u2019s bonus was not based on time, but rather by how much electrical cabling they could remove during a four week period. Each meter removed would give the group $1. The group of four could usually pull out $1000 worth of cable if they were good and working on a large enough ship. Smaller ships only had a few hundred meters of cabling, but the larger ships would have upwards of several kilometers of cable. The current record is held by Electrical Systems Specialist Shipbreaker Crew 17, who in early 2282 managed to pull $4721 worth of cable out of the UNS Mavis Grind, humanity's first ever highliner. Their picture still hangs on the wall in the crew cafeteria. \n\nAfter the narrowbacks finish the ship is handed off to the computer systems specialists, who walk around Deimos wearing purple EP suits, feeling better than everyone else. Nobody knows if you have to be an asshole to become a slycer, or if becoming a slycer makes you an asshole, but there is fierce debate any time a purple EP suit walks into the crew cafeteria. The team of four remove all of the ship's computer hardware, and AI systems. Their on time bonus is based on the ship's class, but is generally never more than a week long. \n\nThe computers, circuit cards, AI cores and computer chips are all cataloged and sorted on the surface by general shipbreakers, who return any proprietary software and AI back to their company of manufacture as required by law. UN fines are no joke. 17 years ago Grey Star Shipbreaking in the Proxima Centauri system was fined 90% of their yearly profits for not returning a proprietary AI system. \n\nEverything not proprietary is reduced to component parts and sold back to manufacturers as raw materials, unless special orders are placed with the companies for specific parts. An unknown buyer from Yost had recently placed an order for an exceedingly rare and old AS400 micrologic controller and was willing to pay up to $37,500 for it. Computer Systems Specialist Shipbreaker Crew 199 found one aboard the TNC Clear Waters, and were paid a bonus of $1000. \n\nThe next group into orbit are the engine systems specialists, wearing red and calling themselves ASE\u2019s. Why and when they started doing this has been lost to years of telling and retelling of drunken stories. Nobody knows what it stands for anymore. The group of four carefully cut and remove the ship's engine or engines, depending on the ship's class. Once fully removed it is loaded onto a transportation ship and shuttled back to the surface, where it is classified, cataloged and put up for sale by the company. If a group of ASE\u2019s can remove a ship's engine in one week they\u2019ll get their on time bonus. Almost none of them do. \n\nOnce everything valuable has been removed from the ship it will be tethered to the moon and then crashed into the surface, where ground crews of general shipbreakers will spend their days cutting apart what remains. For every 100kg of ship that is pulled out of the graveyard and brought to the recycling facility on the surface of Deimos a shipbreaker is paid $3.50. \n\nOnce brought back to the recycling facility the final speciality class of shipbreakers, process men, will go to work. Clad in verdant green they analyze the material composition of the ship pieces, further separate metals and then smelt them down into liquid. If a process man can produce 100kg of a single liquid metal in ten standard hours they will have hit their bonus requirement. The liquid metals are then loaded into specialized containers which keep their liquid state and are sold to shipyards as is. 1kg of liquid aluminum was currently trading for $4.75. 1kg of liquid titanium could easily net the company $19.50 in profit. \n\nIn total, after all expenses are accounted for, each ship brought into the Johanssen shipbreaking yards obtained for the company anywhere from $400,000- $82,000,000. Depending greatly on the prices of the metals pulled out of the graveyard and how many of the shipbreaking crews hit their bonuses.

My mother would have to take care of me and my little brothers but when she had to go to work she would leave us with an old lady in the village.\n\nWe called this old lady Odah, but she wasn\u2019t really our grandmother. She would sell fruit from her little shack during the day while my brothers and I would cause trouble in her makeshift backyard. To keep us amused, and I\u2019m sure to stop us from destroying her house, she would tell us old stories. I knew all of the old folk tales from the village, but her stories were different. Some of them, she admitted, she\u2019d heard from the Dutch when she was a little girl. But most of them were from her own creation. She said she often just had stories in her head but because she couldn\u2019t write them down she memorised all of them. As a child, I loved her stories. Sometimes I would even go back just to ask her to tell me a specific story and she was always more than happy to. \n\nEventually my father came back and managed to get a job in Bali. After a few years he had made enough money and we all moved to Bali where our lives improved significantly. My brothers and I were all sent to a good school and we were all able to get a good education. \n\nDuring school breaks my mother would still take us back to the old village and I would always visit Odah. She was getting older and weaker but when I would ask to tell me a story her eyes would light up and we\u2019d both be transported back to a time when I was a small child. \n\nAfter I finished high school I was accepted into the Universitas Indonesia in Jakarta. Odah\u2019s stories had instilled in me a lifelong love of literature and so I studied arts at university. I decided to give something back to Odah. I had heard her stories for many years and had memorised all of them and so I wrote them down. With the little money I had, I had them professionally bound. Over the four years I was at university I gave Odah dozens of her stories which she kept all piled up in a special corner of her shack. She loved them so much and she even told me that she was learning how to read them.\n\nIn 2013 a tropical cyclone hit the Nusa Tenggara islands. I was in Singapore at the time working as a journalist. There was no way I could get back right away but as soon as it was safe to do so I went back to the islands. I\u2019ll never forget what I saw. The main street in the village was destroyed. Their wooden houses were knocked down and debris lay everywhere. It was difficult to recognise where Odah\u2019s house was but as I got closer I could see it. The roof had caved in and fruit was floating on the flood waters. The water around her house was black and looked like a river of ink. Remnants of the books lay in pieces around the house. I asked around if anyone had seen Odah but everyone was worried about their own families. I tried looking for hours but I had no luck. \n\nOdah had no funeral. I don\u2019t even know if anyone really missed her. But I did. \n\nI got back to Singapore and started rewriting her stories. I had written them down in the original Balinese but this time I translated them to Indonesian. After months of trying eventually some of my connections in the publishing world came through and I got her stories published. I used the pen name Odah Tengarra. After all, these were her stories, not mine. \n\nShamelessly I wrote a story about Odah which my editor, probably due to my grief, agreed to publish in our magazine. It wasn\u2019t a big piece but it did draw attention to her collection of short stories. The public were touched and soon the stories became widely read in Indonesia. Our readers in Singapore were curious about these stories and so they were also translated to Singaporean Mandarin, Malay and English. I had included some of the stories she had heard from the Dutch and so her stories were read in Europe as well. \n\nThe collection of stories wasn\u2019t exactly a bestseller but it was making money. I took the profits and donated it back to the old village. I had a library built in her honour and I could even employ some teachers to teach the local children how to read.\n\nIn front of the library I commissioned a statue to be built of Odah reading to a young child.

I don\u2019t... Where was I again? \n\nAfter a minute of walking, we reached a familiar door, and I began to remember everything. We were at the hospital, with a visit to Dr. E. \u201cPlease come on inside.\u201d Said the woman with a husky voice.\n\nAs we opened the door, Dr. E was sitting on his desk, reading paper files.. \u201cMr. And Mrs. Dubov, please sit down.\u201d Dr. E\u2019s soft voice came to us. We sat down on the two chairs in front of Dr. E\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cMr. Dubov, after some talks with your neurologist, we figured you might be showing some signs of dementia.\u201d \n\n\u201cDementia?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Dubov. With the state of our medical research right now, unfortunately no cure has been found for such a disease. But what we can do, as stated here in your primary care plan, is to delay the disease functioning, and prolong your current quality of life. For this, we would need a lot of your help, Mrs. Dubov\u201d.\n\nAfter some more talks with Dr. E, we left the hospital.\n\nIn this cold, winter night, all I could think about was Sarah. It is real - I have dementia,  but I would never want to forget about Sarah and the perfect love that we have shared all throughout the years.\n\nI stopped walking, faced her, looked at her eyes, and held her hands tightly. Everything came flashing back \u2013 every single little thing I would never want to forget. How we met on those woods when we were kids, how we danced barefooted on the same place after being married, and the way it felt, professing our love in front of the altar. I couldn\u2019t help but produce a tear.\n\n\u201cHoney?\u201d Sarah\u2019s sweet voice spoke. \n\n\u201cSarah, I don\u2019t want to forget you Sarah, my wife, my love!\u201d I spoke, crying.\n\n\u201cHoney, honey, look at me. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m with you. I won\u2019t leave your side. You\u2019re the love of my life and I won\u2019t let little dementia take you away from me. We have each other. We\u2019ll get through this. Together.\u201d\n\nWith Sarah\u2019s words, all my worry about dementia subsided. I guess when you find that perfect love, everything just seems to fall into place.

I break for second supper soon and wish to finish my meal before the second sets.*\n\nBentley, Prosecuting: *Of course, Prefect. The State of Upton wishes to bring attempted homicide charges against the defendant and request that bail be set at two million dollars, as per the guidelines set out in the Upton Criminal Code.*\n\nPrefect Charpentier frowns, squiting down at the case notes in front of him. He looks up and stares at Brad Bentley.\n\nPrefect Charpentier: *Explain to me how the defendant went from cooking to being arrested on attempted homicide charges.*\n\nBentley, Prosecuting: *Of course, Prefect. Well, you see, first of all, the defendant is no normal defendant; he is an alien, a shapehshifting alien wearing somebody else's face and skin.*\n\nPrefect Charpentier: I...see.\n\nBentley, Prosecuting: *And I will now go on to explain how The State determined this.  You see, on the night of the 3rd, last year, the defendant - an alien shapeshifter - began cooking a meal on an electric stove. The defendant then left the cooking unattended. A short while later, the cooking burnt and the entire property was filled with smoke, setting off detectors. At the time, there was only one other inhabitant in the property at the time.*\n\nPerfect Charpentier: *Mhmm.*\n\nBentley, Prosecuting: *The State argues that there is clear evidence that the defendant - an alien shapeshifter in disguise - wrongly believed that the other inhabitant had asthma and with this belief in mind, maliciously intended to cause a fatal asthma attack by deliberately leaving the cooking unattended, thereby causing it to burn and smoke. The inhabitant's relatives are well aware that none of them have asthma, ergo, The State proved that the defendant was in fact an alien shapeshifter in disguise, given that were he not an alien shapeshifter in disguise, then he would know that none of his relatives actually have asthma.*\n\nPrefect Charpentier nods enthusiastically.\n\nPrefect Charpentier: *Go on, go on.*\n\nBentley, Prosecuting: *So, the defendant - an alien shapeshifter in disguise - acting on the belief that the other inhabitant had severe asthma, set out to cause a fatal asthma attack. In the State's eyes, this would be akin to somebody sprinkling large amounts of nuts over food in the belief that the food is meant for somebody with a serious nut allergy which could kill them when nuts are consumed; or, pulling the trigger of a firearm with the intent to kill. Furthermore, albeit a little premature, The State would also like to make known its intent to pursue the death penalty.*\n\nPrefect Charpentier nods.\n\nPrefect Charpentier: *Okay, I have heard prosecuting. Would the defendant's attorney like to say anything?*\n\nReece Fallows, Defending: *Nothing to say at this time, Prefect.*\n\nPrefect Charpentier: *Okay, in light of the above, this court will accept the charges of attempted homicide which have been put forward and I am remanding the defendant in custody and bail is set at two point seven five million dollars.

Air\nInhale, exhale, repeat for as long as your brain functions, but what is it you\u2019re breathing in? Typical air is a mixture of 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, and less than 1% of a mixture of other gasses and environmental particulate. Air\u2019s malicious nature is that it doesn\u2019t want to end you, it wants to prolong your suffering for as long as possible. There are  those rare cases that air isn\u2019t plentiful enough to allow it to continue your suffering, which brings our story to Tyler Mcible.\n\nAlone on an Alaskan peak, Tyler berated himself for not taking into account elevation sickness on his current exploration. His career as an influencer had become stagnant and he was running out of exotic locations to post. His follower count was dipping and he needed new content quickly, which was why he didn\u2019t wait the few days to acclimate to this altitude. \n\nIt was late spring in Alaska so air was maintaining its temperature in the high forties to mid fifties to help prevent Tyler from freezing. Air was enjoying his suffering. It studied Tyler as a mad doctor would study a rat being subjected to unethical experiments. Air had seen so many other cocky explores subject to the same conditions that air could almost predict every next move Tyler would make. \n\nLaying prone, Tyler gasped exhausted, his extremities tingled from oxygen deprivation. Air chuckled to itself, why would living things choose to utilize a component that was only a fifth of air\u2019s composition? Animated objects had since their development had thrown that offense at air. Tyler looked toward the bottom of the slope, a valley filled with Nagoonberry plants about sixteen hundred feet down was the only hope he had to escape his oppressive lack of air. Air was skeptical of Tyler making it. \n\nTyler grasped the snow cover, pulling himself inch by excruciating inch. Even with gravity\u2019s aid he could only manage a few yards a minute. He considered even putting us body perpendicular to the slope and rolling, but thought an uncontrolled descent would be too dangerous. He\u2019d just have to crawl for the better part of a day. This feat, air would enjoy spectating. Air was even so benevolent as to supply more of itself as a reward for the progress Tyler made. Tyler took this kindness for granted and went so far as to continue to curse air for its lack of presence. \n\nThe journey took seven hours, but finally Tyler had made it to the bottom of the valley. The snowpack had given way to cold mud as Tyler crawled the remaining few feet to the lowest point he could reach. A cool breeze swept through the Nagoonberries carrying with it the fragrance of their flowers. Tyler, though exhausted and knowing he would have to sleep there for the night, allowed himself a deep breath of celebration at having not succumbed to Air\u2019s demented experimentation. The scent, which Tyler had yet to experience being as it was his first time to Alaska was one of the most calming smells he noted. Calming, right to the point the tingle of the first sneeze sprang from his chest. Please remember that air is not only composed of gasses, it carries all the particles small enough to go aloft.\n\nAnaphylactic shock set in quickly for Tyler. There was no way he could have known that the fragrant plants he was among would have produced such a sever reaction. Air smiled, as much a smile as an inanimate thing could, in deep satisfaction. The gasps were sweet music to it.

His cold visage in the corner of my eye filled my chest with anxiety, unwilling to even look in his direction. He must have taken this as an insult, as he bent down, grabbing me by the chin and forcing me to look straight at him.\n\nAn unsettling spectacle graced his face, as an impenetrable void breached his once-filled sockets.

He held me far above him with monstrous strength. I had but one last attempt at escape with my teeth sinking into his wrist. Blood seeped down his arm, but he gave no reaction. \n\nImmediately after, I felt the cold and harsh surface hit my body. The incessant buzzing became louder. I wanted to scream, but my words were too feeble. \n\nI managed to open an eye and spied around at my surroundings. Bodies upon bodies littered the corners of the room. Anger grew in my heart as I saw the viciously murdered comrades of my past, but none of it could come out.

I wanted to scream my heart out at the terror the endless eyes brought me, but I choked on the little air that remained during my rapid breathing.\n\nA tear slowly rolled down my cheek. My limbs had lost all of their strength, leaving me powerless. Falling further to the floor, my mind had lost the last of its senses, crumbling to a catatonic state. I could still feel and think, but a reaction was beyond my strength.\n\nOnce more I heard metallic thudding, only making the buzzing in my mind louder. I felt my body lifted once again.

It caressed my skin softly and filled me with newfound hope. My once cold body had now been reinvigorated as my mind accepted this gift. I opened my arms to the abyss.\n\nMy heart was then reclaimed by the cold. The void groped at my body and ripped it of all that was left.

His appearance was inconspicuous. At second glance, some women said that he had a handsome face but they mostly did not notice him at first glance. He was of average height, slim, not athletic. Brown hair, a muddy color. His teeth were neat, like an orderly front yard because he took brushing and flossing very seriously. In winter, his hands became dry and inflamed and he never used lotion so they always hurt. He had a simple head but the wisdom to know that. He had made up his mind about the world in relatively shallow but sufficient fashion. His position was clear to him and, should not occur some drastic change, would be so for the rest of his days. He had missed the few big chances he had had but was just fine with it. He worked in an office in a minor administrative position and brought home a salary that was right in line with any statistic about the lower middle class. He enjoyed watching TV. He knew that it wasn\u2019t an enriching activity but what, he asked himself, did he need to be enriched for when work was done? He knew that he would not contribute anything particular, anything striking to the world and had stopped deceiving himself about that truth long ago. He was born to be a gearwheel, and so he would not hurt anybody, would not disrupt anything, do his job and remain quiet. One day he would find a woman that was as attractive as him, probably occupying a minor administrative position and he would marry her and have some children, and all, if nothing out of the ordinary happened, would be born to be gearwheels, neat and nondescript, turning until the day they stopped. The world would be spinning the same with the genepool of Jack Edgar roaming its surface, or not. \n\nAll of these things would sound terribly depressing to the dreamer out there, might his dreams be an end in themselves, who knows, because the world would have you believe that being a dreamer is essential. \n\nJack increasingly settled, increasingly became comfortable, more and more liked what he saw in the mirror. He got up and smiled in the morning. Why shouldn\u2019t he consider himself handsome? There was the broad forehead and the prominent cheekbones. There was the stubby little nose and the thin lips but the shadow of a thick beard could conceal these pretty well. He thought back and recalled quite a number of compliments he had gotten throughout life. He decided to make it a ritual to recall them every morning to feel better. Why shouldn\u2019t he be fine with his job? Most of his colleagues were nice and with some of them, upon meeting them in the office, he enjoyed a pleasant little chat. And as time went on, he himself, and other people, discovered the humorous side of him and the ability to make those around him laugh in some of the right moments. \n\nWhen he came home, he usually switched on the TV and let anything that it showed pour out of it, while leisurely letting his attention wander through the talk shows and movies and sitcoms. \n\nThen, one night, he never knew what had driven him to do it, he opened an old box with belongings of his late grandfather and examined the contents. Next to a bunch of photos, the pipe, the old man\u2019s favorite hat, there were some dusty books. He investigated them, not in the least eager, but remembered some of the names from school and then found out that they all were established classics in english literature. Half ironic, he took one of them \u2018The picture of Dorian Grey\u2019, opened it and in homage to Frank Edgar, took the pipe between his teeth and half died of a coughing fit, for he had inhaled some particle of old tobacco. Recovered, he began to read and fought, like every person unaccustomed with reading, through the first strong onset of boredom but on page twenty was gripped by zeal. He finished the book in three days, picked up the next, finished that and became somewhat of an avid reader and discovered the meaning and the value of an enriching activity, which he had, so long, dismissed. He never touched the pipe again. \n\nHe eventually even joined a book club, where some locals got together and read and discussed what they had read and Jack made friends there. Fine people, philanthropists, working in soup kitchens and buying christmas gifts for the poor children. There was a world beyond, Jack realized. Your own personal horizon, he understood, wasn\u2019t the end, and for the first time he grasped what it meant to broaden it. \n\nHe lay wondering oftentimes now, when in bed at night, about that future wife and the kids that would somewhere down the line, enrich his life like books had done and the people in the book club.

Your little ray of sunshine is depending on you now to do what\u2019s best for him, and in the end we know you will. No one wants to deal with something so heart-wrenching but in times like this, it has to be done swiftly. Good folks stick together to help each other in times like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you Martha! I appreciate it. I really do. You guys are so good to me. I just don\u2019t have the strength to pull the trigger. How do we know he\u2019s really suffering? Like you said, he was already a little wild hellion child. Maybe he doesn\u2019t feel any pain anymore. Surely being like this is still better than being\u2026 dea\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Jane. Noooo. He\u2019s infected. He\u2019s frothing at the mouth for heaven\u2019s sake. Just look at him! He has spasms and violent mood swings. He\u2019d tear you to pieces if you got any closer. Your boy is not himself. It\u2019s highly contagious and he\u2019s in immense pain. You can see that when you look into his dilated pupils. Plus, what if he bites you? One of us will have to put you down too, and none of us wants to have to do that. It would\u2019ve been totally unnecessary and preventable. There\u2019s no saving him, but we can help support you. Take care of your boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you please, pretty please do it for me, Martha? You just said you are all here to help. I can\u2019t do it. That would help me immensely if you or Earl would\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would take care of you because we had no choice. There would be no one else left to do it but that\u2019s not even close to the same situation, and it\u2019s not fair of you to ask us. Frankly, we\u2019re worried your sick little feller will bite you, and then you could spread it to all of us. Doing this will make you a much stronger woman! Every person should take care of their own \u2018mess\u2019. I\u2019m sorry to be harsh but this is yours, Jane. You must clean it up.\u201d\n\nJane Weaver looked around the room with a deepening level of realization. The real truth slowly slid out of their forked tongues. They weren\u2019t nearly as supportive as they pretended to be. It was a more of a pushy confrontation than \u2018loving support\u2019. Resentment was building rapidly in her heart. She wanted to lash out at them but the problem of what to do about her infected hellion still remained. The thought of having to blow his brains out was unbearable. Meanwhile, they stood there with their cold, calculating eyes.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf any of you had been more diligent about eliminating those infected creatures lurking in the woods, none of this would be an issue! Then he would still be himself! You knew rabid skunks and foxes were dangerous, and yet you did nothing about them. That is YOUR mess, and you need to clean THAT up! Perhaps I\u2019ll just let Ol\u2019 Blue out of his containment pen, and then you\u2019ll be forced to take care of my good little boy, yourselves.\u201d", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "Holding the Door Open", "text": "I go into an immediate cold sweat when I see it. There, not more than 50 feet in front of me is a man holding the door open to the grocery store. His soft smile and kind eyes help this good-natured older gentleman give off the aura of a man who is just happy to help out other people in any which way he can, and right now, that help is coming in the form of holding the door open for me.\n\nEven at this distance, I can see him wink and nod his head in the safest and most inviting way possible. He's practically begging for me to walk through his open door. I gulp because I know at my normal walking speed, I'll be inconveniencing him. I hate disappointing people, especially a man like that who is glowing with kindness.\n\nI make some short lived eye contact and weakly wave, my hand not even reaching above shoulder level. He nods again with complete understanding and a sort of fatherly love. With those Skechers firmly rooted in the pavement and that vascular, strong forearm gripping the door with a strength and ease that makes me feel like a hug from him would be one of the most satisfying experiences in my life, he waits.\n\nI'm still an uncomfortable distance away, so I half heartedly jog. He waves me on, encouraging my effort. The parking lot seems to stretch on further than I realized, and I don't want to keep such a helpful gentleman waiting. I can't bear the burden of knowing that his time better spent shopping for groceries was wasted holding open a door, a door I am perfectly capable of opening myself, on such a pathetic loser like me.\n\nI jog harder, but my legs feel heavy and I just can't seem to make any forward progress. The beating sun is torturous as it burns and mocks my attempt at hurrying. The man waves on harder as if he were the third base coach and I, a kid on his little league team, was scared and confused as to what to do as I round the bases. The trust in his eyes pierces my very soul. I can't let him down.\n\nI'm running now, harder than I have in a long time, trying to reach that door, that open door leading to a world of cool air and satisfaction, but I can't. The expanse stretches on further and further like an unforgiving desert of asphalt. The other cars are gone, the lines for parking are gone, the buildings, the trees, everything but the grocery store and the kindly man are gone. The sky is infinite blue oblivion with the harsh, unforgiving sun domineering over all.\n\nI'm pushing my body as hard as I can now, not knowing what else I can do. I'm afraid if I look behind me, everything I've ever known will be gone. My legs strain and my feet ache. My lungs burn as they struggle to take in the oxygen my muscles and heart are screaming for. This grocery store is my sanctuary now and this man, this benevolent man, my savior. I'm running from the abyss, running from everything that has ever been, everything I ever was.\n\nOnward I stride, my hands cutting through the thick, hot air. My face and shoulders blister as the sun does its best to destroy me. The hairs on the back of my neck are standing on end as the eerie feeling of being chased consumes me. This sprinting is that of survival like the frightened gallop of a chased gazelle. The pumping of my stressed heart can be felt in my ears.\n\nI stumble and fall. The searing asphalt scrapes and burns my skin. I'm scared for my life now. Despite my best efforts, I'm still so far away. I shut my eyes tightly as this impending doom approaches from behind.  My only option is to surrender to the abyss, lose my body and soul to whatever cosmic power has cursed me into this existence. Tears stream down my cheeks and evaporate on the parking lot pavement.\n\nBehind me in the searing oblivion are the screams of billions of souls from billions of worlds, formless, anguished, eternal suffering in an ephemeral state. Then the drone starts, a deep, sonorous hum. It looms over the atmosphere, drowning out the cosmic torment, until it becomes so oppressive that I feel it in my bones. They twist and turn, writhing in the hot agony of my melting flesh. I am just about to add my screams to the rest.\n\nThen I hear him.\n\n\"C'mon, son! I've got the door open for ya!\" His powerful voice rings out like church bells, a beacon for my panicked soul. There he is, through the blur of radiating heat, I see him. His golden arm still stalwart in holding open that door to safety. He's waving me in. He's smiling. He believes in me.\n\nI get back up, inspired now. The heat fades. My body cools. That terrible drone leaves my body. I have strength again. My legs carry me faster than any speed I have ever known. The wind rips my shirt apart like tissue paper as I glide across the lot. The expanse is closing now, however slightly, but it is closing. I'm doing it. I feel the man's confidence in me give me strength. My shoes fly off. There's no need for such earthly luxuries now. The raw human spirit coursing through me is all I need. I will make it. The gap between the abyss and the door is shrinking. My body is like a divine engine.\n\nCloser and closer. Harder and harder. Faster and faster. I am not a boy anymore. I've ascended to something far greater. So close now. The background is beginning to return, the cars, the trees, the people, the world.\n\nFinally, I reach the door, the kind man, the beautiful figure and savior who rescued my soul from oblivion. I hug him with tear filled eyes and thank him so much for everything he's done. He's made me a far better person. My fears and anxieties, my self doubt and self loathing, everything holding me back - they're gone, and he's to thank.

Ananias ignored him and walked towards the statue of a Saul.\n\nHe studied him for a moment. Saul did not seem capable of it. No man alone did. To destroy the tower that had stood for generations in a single night. The reason seemed clear. Saul had spent his life building the tower, and now knew he would never see it finished. Still, something did not seem right. Why would he remain to face execution if he was responding to a life in service of the church?\n\n\"It doesn't matter.\" Saul's head bobbed as he moved his jaw. The clay had begun to harden under his chin.\n\nAnanias was startled and jumped slightly before asking \"What did you say?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter.\" Saul responded.\n\n\"What doesn't matter?\"\n\nSaul let out a long sigh before saying once more \"It doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"What does matter?\"\n\nSaul met Ananias's stare. \"That's a good question.\"\n\nWith that, Saul closed his eyes.

Hollinder, activate our emergency reactor! And Jett, figure out who the hell managed to knock us out of hyperspace!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Hollinder ran out of the room to activate the emergency generators, and the other crewmen began their tasks, the ship\u2019s commander ran his hand through his graying hair and looked around him, admiring the tenacity of the crew. Even after being abruptly ripped out of their hyperspace lane, even in the low visibility of the emergency lights, they had composed themselves and immediately got to work to figure out the specifics of what had just happened. After a brief moment, the ship\u2019s main lights flickered back on, the ship began to right itself, and control systems were brought back online. The commander immediately flicked forward the throttle on his control pad to activate the engines. Luckily, there were no significant damages. That was until Hollinder reported back to his commander.\r\n\r\nHe said that he had begun performing diagnostics after activating the ship\u2019s surplus fusion reactor\u4e00a routine procedure in a situation such as theirs\u4e00but was interrupted by a warning message. Their jump drive had been disabled, likely as a result of the abrupt conclusion to their hyperspace journey. The commander was immediately unnerved upon hearing this.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat could possibly disable a Nova drive?\u201d he asked, his steely tone masking the knot in his stomach. Hollinder only shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cI dunno....nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe commander quickly turned to his right, in the direction of his main advisor and communications specialist, Thomas Jett.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know anything about failures involving a Nova drive?\u201d he asked with the same tone as before. Jett messed around with the screen in front of him for a moment before replying.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn 236 years, roughly 754 million hyperspace jumps have been made using Lightskip Corp. drives. For all of the 136 million jumps that were made in the 77 years that the Nova model has been available for military applications, there has not been a single incident of hyperdrive failure reported. Make that one.\u201d he added the last part under his breath. The commander looked away for a moment, quickly sighed, then looked back at Jett.\r\n\r\n\u201cOpen a communications channel,\u201d he said before turning back in front of him. Jett tapped a few buttons on his monitor and waited. After a few seconds, he turned to the commander.\r\n\r\n\u201c...where do you want to send a message to?\u201d he asked expectantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnywhere!\u201d the commander yelled back.\r\n\r\nJett used his monitor to find the nearest military outpost with hyperspace capable ships, then snapped his fingers.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re rolling.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is Jameson Hoth, commander of the Valiant-class starship Invictus.

What...is that?\u201d\r\n\r\nJett looked forward through the front window of the ship and saw what Hoth was pointing at. Some kind of octagonal craft had drifted into view in front of them. Suddenly, everyone shifted forward in the room, as the Invictus came to a complete stop in an instant. As a few of his crew got back to their feet after falling forward, Hoth let out a shallow breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cJett.

Surely you\u2019re not planning on going to war with an...an alien spaceship when we have no way to escape?\u201d\r\n\r\nHoth let out a heavy sigh. \u201cVesper, I am your commander. And I am ordering you to ready our weapons. Now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAye aye, captain,\u201d Vesper muttered flatly. He turned to his monitor and typed a couple of words on the screen. He scrolled through a few submenus and hit a button.\r\n\r\n\u201cPredators are hot. Just...promise me you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Vesper begged.\r\n\r\nHoth replied with the one thing he didn\u2019t want to hear.\r\n\r\n\u201cFire.\u201d\r\n\r\nVesper dropped his head, looked to the ceiling, then closed his eyes, sighed, and pressed a button next to his monitor. \u201cThey\u2019re out.\u201d\r\n\r\nA dozen warheads screamed towards the alien ship.

He wanted to stay in his room, but I was insisting he come play with me. I was banging on his door, ignoring his protests to leave him alone. I think I even dented the door at one point.

I don\u2019t remember the fall, just the impact. My head hit first, there was a deep ringing inside my head, then silence. I came to a few minutes later, in a small pool of blood. I cleaned the wound from my head and just ignored it like it never happened.\u201d There was no way she could reflect that much detail. I\u2019m not sure if that event even happened.

Although Rose did sneak into my room to comfort me and thank me while treating my injuries.\n\nBut that still wasn\u2019t the worst thing that happened. The worst thing was that I began to notice Rose. I noticed her beautiful long hair, her soft round face, everything about her was beautiful. Her hobbies were fun to take part in, she was a great study partner, and the few friends she had were a blast to be around. We even went on a few dates by ourselves, not just ones to get my family off my back either. I couldn\u2019t deny it any longer, I was falling for her, and she even said \u201cI love you.\u201d to me.\n\nThat\u2019s what made her leaving suddenly so painful. Her family had informed her that they and their business was moving overseas, and if she wanted to take over the family business like she wanted she would have to move with them once she graduated. It was a hard decision, but she decided to go through with it. After all, she didn\u2019t need to be my girlfriend anymore now that my family called of the engagement and disowned me. That\u2019s why she said she hated me, because in the process of being my girlfriend, we both fell in love, and we both had to end thing on a bittersweet note. Without my family\u2019s money, I didn\u2019t know if I would be able to move to the country she was going to. I would have to find my own job and raise enough to go myself, and she didn\u2019t know if she would be able to visit me while running the business. \n\nWe both stood there, waiting for her ride to the airport, reflecting on all that had led us up to this point. I wish things didn\u2019t have to end this way, I loved her too much and I hated myself for it. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.\n\nHer ride eventually came, and we kissed each other one last time.

A beautiful, large healthy oak tree. Her leaves, green and lush, keep her going for centuries. She\u2019s perched upon a small hill overlooking a vast field of vibrant flowers. Truly an awesome sight to behold, not only to her, but to those who keep her company. Now the tree has many visitors: birds, bugs, and bees alike. However, her favorites are the two children who play together in the field and collect themselves under her shade. A girl and a boy, no older than eight. They play all day, wasting not a moment away.

Time moves on, and the tree\u2019s leaves tint to colors of red, yellow, and orange. She feels the pang of loneliness, for she hasn\u2019t seen her children in quite some time.

All the critters come to seek haven within the cozy bark. Still yet to see the children she cares for so dearly. As more time stretches on, the flowers around the tree start to bloom again. Her leaves once more fill with chlorophyll. From across the field a distant sound of joyousness and laughter is heard. The children. The boy and the girl.

The two run and laugh through the field, towards the tree. The tree once again giving her shade unconditionally to them. They sit close with each other, resting upon the tree.

No moon or planet was untouched, no cavity of the endless expanse held any solace for her. She drifted for an eternity, sometimes further into the expanse where it took longer for them to find her, but eventually they always found her. Millennia came and millennia went, and she had lost hope. Resigning herself to the chase, until one small whisper reached her that sounded nothing like the others. It almost sounded welcoming, cold and even, with no room for false intentions or deception. So she gave this voice an audience in her mind, having no reason to distrust even the smallest glimpse of hope. If this venture went wrong, all she would have to do is run as she always did. So where was the harm?\n\nIt lured her closer to her pursuers, closer than she had ever dared go on her own. In the ever circling race, she for the first time in her infinite existence ventured to the very core of the expanse, where all eyes were drawn. Her dancing grew direct, flowing with less and less deviation towards this small voice in the void. Until there she was at the very core of existence, and she danced in place, spinning with no direction or need to move from where she stood. The voice enveloped her, drowning out her fear of the eyes, wrapping her in a safe cloud of sound and her own beauty. She no longer felt the eyes forever piercing her soul, no longer chasing her. She was safe, but how? \n\nFor the first time in her existence she stood still and just looked around her. She looked out and saw millions of stars, all circling around her and for once saw how they too were beautiful. They shone through the darkness that surrounded them, in a defiance of what constantly threatened to snuff them out. She saw them stand their ground against their perceived enemy and envied their courage in contrast to her fear. She wondered if they were as scared as she was. And what gave them the courage to face that fear rather than flee? But these thoughts all quickly fled as she questioned how she was able to finally sit stagnant, why was she no longer fleeing? \n\nShe sat in the very center of the universe, in a black hole that seemed to defy all light. It did not pierce the space she was in, and yet it was still present. All the light was drawn in, then bent around its edges, leaving an infinite void within. A void that was somehow welcoming. Honest in its intent and its actions. It meant her no harm and yet did not care for her. It simply allowed her to exist within it. She questioned its intent, why had it reached out to her and saved her? And its response was indifference. He had sat here unmoving for an eternity just as she had run and danced, and yet she had never ventured to him. She had never even acknowledged his existence and never asked for help. He felt he might as well take that step as he had grown bored of her dance. He cared not for it, and wanted momentary peace. More for himself than for her. And so he fell silent again.

Today he was quietly reading a book on his balcony.\n\n\u201cHey there\u201d shouted Namita but Pankaj didn\u2019t respond.\n\n\u201cI am your new neighbour, I have just moved today\u201d.\n\n\u201cHello, Myself Pankaj\u201d, Pankaj replied in an impersonal tone. He didn\u2019t even look at her.\n\n\u201cThat's a bit rude\u201d thought Namita, \u201cCan\u2019t he give a bit of a warm welcome, no I am here to help if you need anything\u201d.\n\nNamita shrugged it off and got back to her cup of tea.\n\nNext day in the evening she again saw him on the balcony. This time again she initiated conversation. Pankaj was more warm in his response. But Namita sensed awkwardness in his body language. He was not making eye contact while conversing. She thought it was normal being a bit awkward in the beginning. \n\nThese small talks continued for 2-3 days. But Namita always notices he\u2019s not comfortable with her because of how he avoids eye contact with her. \n\n\u201cMaybe something is wrong with her eyes, huh\u201d She thought. \n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\nOver the weekend she was coming down stairs to throw some stuff. She was quite exhausted and not being mindful. The new stairs were less forgiving of her lack of attention and she slipped on the stairs. Luckily at the end moment she was caught by none other than Pankaj. \n\n\u201cI am so sorry\u201d she said, taking back control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem\u201d replied Pankaj.\n\n\u201cWait, did he just look into my eyes \u2026 Yes he did. And he  has beautiful eyes\u201d thought Namita. She thanked him again and continued on her way. She kept thinking about his eyes.  \n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\nThey started having a daily routine of talking though balconies now. Pankaj was also more comfortable with her now. They discuss their daily lives in the evening. Namita even asked him why he doesn\u2019t mingle with anyone else in society. He just replied he's a bit shy.\n\nAfter a few days Namita invited Pankaj over for a party. \n\n\u201cCome we\u2019ll have fun. I have asked my office colleagues to come over too\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try but i can\u2019t promise\u201d Pankaj tried to shrug it off.\n\n\u201cPlease please, you have not  even seen my flat yet. We just talk over balconies\u201d\n\n\u201cOk I\u2019ll try to make it\u201d\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nFinally Friday came and the party started. Namita\u2019s friend started coming in. Everyone was enjoying the party, but Namita was waiting for someone else. \n\nHours went by and Pankaj didn\u2019t come. \n\nAfter everyone left She started cleaning up the flat.\n\nSomeone knocked on the gate. Finally Pankaj arrived.\n\n\u201cWhy are you so late?\u201d asked Namita, a bit annoyed.\n\n\u201cI was just waiting for everyone to leave, you know I am a bit shy. I generally don\u2019t come to the parties but I promised and here I am\u201d.\n\n\u201cWell the party is over. Now you should help with cleanup. This is your punishment\u201d.\n\n\u201cSure\u201d.\n\n\u201cAlso there\u2019s some wine left, please help yourself\u201d\n\nPankaj poured two glasses of wine.\n\nThey started cleaning the flat. Namita shared her experience, how she enjoyed getting everyone here..\n\n\u201cOk, tell me one thing, why were you so afraid of me in the beginning? You never even looked me in the eyes\u201d teased Namita.\n\n\u201cYou want the right answer or wrong one\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, tell me wrong first\u201d\n\n\u201cwell, I am shy\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd real reason\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bit long and you might not like it\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I have all the time and 2 bottles of wine to like your reason\u201d\n\n\u201cOk, I tried to warn you. The thing is I don\u2019t want to look into the people\u2019s eyes\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that. But *why*?\u201d exclaimed Namita.\n\n\u201cBecause I immediately know when and how people are going to die\u201d Pankaj said monotonously.\n\n\u201cWhat? How?\u201d asked Namita with a bewildered look on her face.\n\n\u201cFor some reason when I see through the eyes, I can talk to the soul of the person\u201d\n\n\u201cok, go on\u201d . Suddenly the glass of wine was feeling too heavy to her.\n\n\u201cThe soul tells me when and how they are going to die. I can\u2019t have this burden on me. If I know when a person is going to die and then I can\u2019t just pretend to talk like everything is normal\u201d\n\n\u201cOk but you looked into my eyes and you are very comfortable with me now\u201d asked Namita. Wine\u2019s effect was fading on her.\n\n\u201cYeah, I tried to avoid you. But that day on the stairs I accidentally looked into your eyes\u201d. \n\n\u201cHmm ok. And you don\u2019t feel any burden because of me?\u201d asked Namita in a sobered tone but she felt ghastly.\n\n\u201cNo, because you are already dead*, Pooja*\u201d", "ups": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "The Waters", "text": "    \nHere I sat, in a little shell of a boat made out of rotten wood and rusty nails, below dark and grey skies. The endless ocean around me was completely still, undisturbed by neither wind nor even the littlest of waves. Whenever I gazed upon it, I wasn\u2019t sure if I was looking at the water or the colourless skies; it reflected them so perfectly. When I  put the boat\u2019s paddles into the sea and tried to row in any direction,  it did not move. Even rocking it to and fro did not even cause a ripple on the water\u2019s surface. I spat on it only to watch my saliva fall into nothingness, as though there was an endless hole before me and yet,  whenever I dipped my fingers into the water, it left them wet and frigid. My eyes scoured the horizon in the hopes of seeing land or another ship, though the horizon was nothing but motionless skies and water. \n\nI laid down, staring into the colourless and drab skies, looking for any change within them. There was no ray of sunshine, no clouds,  nothing. Every time I moved a muscle, I felt the boat sway from one side to the other. At first, I was worried I would eventually cause it to tip over but the less I moved, the safer I was. So I lied there,  completely still. There was no sound other than my heartbeat pounding in my head and no smell besides that of the rotten, mouldy wood of my little boat.  \n\nThe only thing I could do, for now, was to entertain myself with my thoughts and memories. \n\nWas it mere minutes? Hours? Days? Perhaps even weeks or months of me just lying there and staring at the sky, not daring to move a muscle? I  had lost all semblance of time. The only thing telling me that I had been lying here for too long was the fact that my own thoughts drove me mad. Again and again, I revisited the same ideas, the same memories and began to hate them. Even the most amusing and joyous thoughts became tortuous whereas the most horrible ones lost their impact entirely.  Eventually, I could no longer tell the difference between being awake and being asleep.  \n\nI watched as walls of water were slowly building up around me in complete silence, as though they were being pulled towards the sky. The ocean reached up higher and higher until it blotted out everything else.  It was as though I was gazing up at mountainous pillars of water. Was the very ocean folding itself around me? Was I dreaming or awake? \n\nSuddenly, something began to violently pull me and my boat downwards, further and further towards the very bottom of the ocean.  Shortly after, I saw the tips of those liquid mountains crash against each other, after which they collapsed unto themselves and began to hurtle towards me in a gargantuan, unstoppable wave that could swallow entire continents. \n\nThe water crashed into me, shattering my bones and tearing off my skin before forcing its way into my lungs. I instinctively gasped for air, only to find my mouth spewing out what felt like litres upon litres of cold water, more than what had just entered my body. Still, I kept fighting for air, only to suddenly find it filling my lungs. I jolted,  my hands reached forwards and found themselves latching onto porcelain.  Immediately, I pulled myself upward and found myself sitting in my bathtub inside my dimly lit bathroom.   \n\nThe bathtub was completely dry.

When she went off to culinary school back in '96, mom was apprehensive. After all, food is fuel, right? All six of us were raised on mom's cooking, since she won the custody battle. Years of stringy, dried out baked chicken and wet, boiled brussels sprouts were all we knew until Abigail came home. She was the oldest, and even though she dropped out of high school, I knew that she was the smartest of all the siblings.\n\nWe stopped seeing much of her after the fellowship began. Occasionally, she would ring up the house and tell us grand stories of bustling Paris streets, endless Italian vineyards, and smelly Grecian fisheries. She described flavors we could only dream of. Shrimp paella speckled with saffron and sage. Braised Cornish game hens stuffed with clementines and maple syrup. French omelette au fromage, a buttery, creamy mess of cheese and eggs that put our greasy American omelettes to shame.\n\nTwo years later, she came home for the holidays. Mom pursed her lips when Abigail declared that she would be cooking the feast. She trudged in with paper bags from a local organic grocer. I'd never seen groceries carried in a paper bag outside of TV sitcoms depicting French people bicycling through the streets with baguettes and greens poking out the top. She dumped the contents onto the counter and divvied up the siblings.\n\nTammy and Billie, the youngest, were charged with dough kneading and vegetable washing respectively. Children don't have the strongest hands, but they are incredibly determined when given tasks of such magnitude. The dough would go on to become homemade biscuits. We slathered them with creamy Irish butter and sweet amber honey. The vegetables were then passed to Persephone, who was instructed in the art of mincing and julienning. Carrots, onions, freshly crushed garlic, and crunchy celery all found their way into a red dutch oven.\n\nTrevor was in charge of spatchcocking the bird; a task he took a bit too much glee in. He dutifully followed Abigail's instructions, removed its spine, and slathered it in exotic spices I had never heard of.\n\n\"What do I do, Abby?\" I chirped as my siblings swarmed around our modest kitchen.\n\n\"Evelyn, love, you're in charge of the most important thing. The potatoes.\" she pointed at the sack of russets on the far counter.\n\n\"Potatoes?\" I said, sticking my tongue out in disgust.\n\n\"Don't worry, sweetie, you've never had them like this,\" Abigail cooed. She showed me how to peel them, though mine looked more like jagged rocks than the perfectly smooth egg-shaped ones she produced. By the time I made it through the five pound sack, I had gotten the hang of it. She boiled salted water in a huge pot and helped me dump the potatoes in.\n\nWhile I waited for them to cook, I sat on the couch next to mom, who was halfway through her third cigarette. She hadn't said much since Abigail came in.\n\n\"What's wrong, mama?\" I said cheerfully. The house was beginning to fill with the mingling holiday scents of chicken broiling on a bed of vegetables, and baked bread cooling on the counter.\n\n\"Nothing, baby. Nothing at all.\" She took another drag. The wisps of gray smoke were tangy and sour compared to the luxurious  smells coming from the kitchen.\n\n\"Is it because Abby is here?\" I asked.\n\n\"No.\" Another drag.\n\nI sat quietly for a while. \"Is it... because she's leaving again tomorrow?\"\n\nMom squeezed her eyes shut. \"Evelyn, why don't you go make sure they don't need any help in there, okay?\" I knew when she was in this mood to just do what she said, so I shrugged and hopped off the couch. As I left the room, I saw her wipe something from her eyes.\n\nFinally, the bird was out of the oven and the potatoes were off of the stove. Abigail was beating an absurd amount of butter, cream, and salt into the potatoes with a handheld beater. When she finished, the whisk attachment had creamy, milky peaks of whipped potatoes hanging off. She popped one off of the beater and handed it to me.\n\n\"Try it,\" she said.\n\nI did. It was just about the best thing I had ever tasted in my entire life.\n\nWe gathered around the long dining room table, our homemade feast spread out in front of us. Abigail dished up the first plate, circled to the far side of the table, and handed it to mom.\n\n\"I want you to have the first bite, mama.\" Her eyes were dewy, and I wasn't sure why.\n\nMom scowled for a moment, then dug her fork into a mound of meat and took a bite. Her eyes widened. \"Abby... sweetie... it's incredible!\"\n\nThe siblings cheered, and for the first time since Abigail left home, mom seemed truly, genuinely happy.", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "The Ethics of Reality", "text": "Ymir stood up from his chair and clapped his hands. \"I've got it!\" The group looked at him expectantly.

She still said them. She felt she *needed* to say them, fearing him the way she did. Yet at the same time, like a malignant tumor ready to burst, she knew deep within her that it really wasn't her that needed to pray. It was him. Wasn't it? All the abuse she'd taken from him since they'd been together, and when was enough supposed to be enough? \n\n How many times had she heard, *\"I\"m sorry, baby.... I swear by all that I hold holy, I'll never do that again...\"* she'd lost count. Just as she'd lost count with the numerous times she'd run away from him, only to have him find her and bring her back. And then all hell would break loose. It would literally be DAYS before she'd venture outside, allowing the bruises to heal.\n\n This night had been like all the others from before. She became jumpy and paranoid with each passing hour. More so when the time she could usually expect him home came and went... hours ago now. Night had settled comfortably, like a well worn jacket, and she began to prepare herself for the worse for when he *did* finally come home. It was a homecoming that she wasn't looking forward to, but knew it to be inevitable at the same time.  \n\nPacing the living room with movements that were quite agitated, her arms would move to cross over her chest only to fling themselves away and to her sides. The prickling began to tear itself piece by piece away from her a little at a time, what little coherency she had been able to cling to was now slipping away from her. Leaving her with a thought that no one could help her. No one would help her. She had only herself to rely on. As it had been since the death of her parents. \n\n Clouded hazel eyes roamed frantically over the living room, searching for some sort of weapon to protect herself. She knew how it would start, it was always the same. He would come stumbling in through the front door and bellow her name. The rage could be heard in his tone, the intensity of it deafening and drowning out the soft pleadings for him to *Please... don't do this... you promised... you promised that you wouldn't...*   She found it better to not run from him, the pain that he would cause when she did run, that much more intense and hurtful.. spiteful even. Yet somehow she knew that tonight would be different. She wouldn't allow him to do this to her anymore. She couldn't. Her peace of mind, her very sanity as she knew it to be, was slipping over an edge where she would never be able to find herself once she fell. \n\nShe remembered the gun at one point, hearing his truck pull into the driveway, she quickly made her way to the hall closet and retrieved it. Checking to see if it were loaded, she breathed a sigh of relief, her hands shaking as she closed the door and made her way back into the living room. To wait for her \"punishment\" as he called it. She never understood what she did wrong, and to him it never mattered. Everything about her was wrong, though he said he loved her.   She felt her heart begin to thump loudly in her chest... beating wildly to the point where she thought she might swoon. Her breathing became more ragged, her cheeks flushed... excitement or fear? She didn't know, perhaps a combination of both. Or maybe it was because she knew, deep down, that tonight she would suffer no more.   *\"Abigail!\"* his voice boomed and echoed as soon as he entered the house, slamming the door behind him with a bang, turning from the foyer and into the living room where he stops, seeing her standing there with her hands behind her back, merely looking at him with those hazel eyes of hers.

Shy little meek mouse that she was.   *\"Come here,\"* he said softly. \n\n Abby shook her head, accenting the motion with one word, *\"No.\"*   Coal black eyes seemed to burn as he looked at her, his anger already surfaced on the ride home, the fury brimming and then spilling over at seeing her, moving out of control at her disobedience. The amount of alcohol he had consumed seemed to not hinder his movements, for he was right there before her before she knew it, breathing his fetid breath into her face, glaring at her, whispering in an ominous tone,   *\"Looks like you really deserve to be punished tonight, doesn't it Abigail?\"* his hands moved from his sides to wrap around her slender throat. His thumbs pressing into her windpipe. Her eyes bulged and she gasped what she though would be her last breath. She felt her strength ebbing, and her eyes fluttered only to open and gaze back into his own.\n\nHer own arms moved from behind her, the sound of the gun being removed from it's safety position lost in his anger, his concentration only what he was doing to her, a smirk played over his features and he grinned at her with malevolence.

You were reincarnated, born as  the youngest prince of the King.\"\n\nI blinked, \"I'm a prince?\"\n\nThe  old man nodded, \"Yes. As per ancient tradition, the first prince  inherits the throne, the second becomes a priest, the third a general,  and the fourth is used for this difficult and expensive ritual. Our last  two only came from small villages of mud huts. You ARE a prince, but  you don't remember it. Your entire life as you now remember in this  moment is your last life. This ritual imprinted on your soul the ability  to remember your past lives.\"\n\n\"Why..do you do this?\"\n\n\"This  ritual is the reason our land has been able to prosper while the others  floundered.

Did you live in mud huts or did you live in some place beyond?\"\n\nI  looked around, at the stone walls covered in char from torches, the  horrible smell of the people around me, and the obvious plethora of  health problems in every person my eyes could meet, \"I don't you have  the right to be complaining about mud huts when you live in such  squalor...\"\n\nThe man in robes was taken aback, \"This... THIS, the kings castle, is squalor?\"\n\nI nodded, \"Yea, although smaller rooms, where I'm from, the poor live better than this.\"\n\nThere  was a collective murmuring from among the crowd. Despite the fact I was  insulting their lifestyle, they seemed genuinely thrilled.\n\n\"And tell me, prince, what was your occupation in your past world?\"\n\nI looked at him, \"Well, I was an engineer.\"\n\n\"What's an engineer?\"\n\n\"Well,  I guess they're people who learn technical stuff from scientists and  figure out how to apply it to the world to make it better.\"\n\n\"So... you have knowledge of how to build from a world where our grand castle here is but a peasant's footnote?\"\n\nI nodded, \"I guess so.\"\n\n\"So, what would you say is greatest achievement of your previous people?\"\n\n\"Greatest?

The world around me was  shooting up, and then I saw... a body... not my body since I didn't  recognize it, wearing medieval clothes, and headless, dripping with  blood. It toppled to the side and fell with me. Out of the corner of my  eye, I saw the king wiping off a sword covered with blood, he was pale,  \"... walking on the moon. Intelligent peasants. Obviously he was no wise  man, but one wrong in the head.\" As my vision faded, I heard him  continue, \"... obviously too dangerous to let live... we would have been  lucky to have mud huts.\"\n\nAnd then, all was dark.\n\nWith  a gasp, I was breathing again. I sat up. I had been sleeping. I looked  around, again, I had no idea where I was, and after the last incident,  no idea who I was. I stood up, and looked around for some clothes.  Nearby was a black robe and a bra. Looking down... it dawned on me that  they were for me. So it wasn't all a dream.... as I dressed, muscle  memory took over. So this life, I was a girl who wore black robes. The  previous, I was some prince. The one before that... well, that's the one  I called \"me\", but apparently that me was long dead. As I finished  dressing, I looked around and noticed a coat rack. On it was a tall  black pointed hat. So I'm a witch? It felt right, so I started to walk  over to it. My body glided as I walked, no bobbing... it was surreal. I  put on the hat. I saw a reflection out of the corner of my eye. A  mirror. I looked good, probably in my late twenties or early thirties  with nice curves.\n\nThere was a  knocked at the door. Opening it up before I could get to it was a small  brunette girl who looked like a smaller version of me. \"Hey mom, you  slept in. Are you okay? That's not like you.\"\n\nI shook my head \"Uh... mommy had a bit too much to drink last night... uh... little girl...\"\n\nThe  girl looked at me, concerned, \"Drinking or potions? You often stay up  late trying to make things to help out... you know my name is Taisha...\"\n\nI  shook my head, quickly coming up with a way to get the gist of it to  her, \"You caught me I guess. It was definitely magic, not potions  exactly, but also not my spell. However, the spell... well...\"\n\n\"DID YOU DO A WIZARD'S DUEL WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE!?!\"\n\nI thought back to what the man in the robes has said.\n\nThat  was a convenient Segway, \"Something like that but not exactly. I can't  remember very much. I know the spell made it so I'd remember past lives,  I think, but I'd forget this one for awhile.\"\n\nThe girl looked shocked, \"So... you don't remember me?\"\n\nI shook my head, \"Not for now...

It was during his reign that almost all who lived within his city's gate suddenly vanished into nothingness, including his majesty. I continue to drink my fill of knowledge as days come and go, learning of the various customs and cultures of the forgotten people. Plates upon plates of inscribed marble, a lifetime's worth of knowledge all mine for the taking.\n\nAs far as living arrangements go, supplies are very scarce. I feed upon the marble mice that fall prey to my rudimentary traps, and water is hard to come by except for the rain which falls exactly every 3 days.

An account written upon a black marble slab, and rather hastily I might add, as I cannot seem to decipher most of the text. Instead, I am left with blanks for my mind to fill in, but with what? From what I could put together, the message seems to be a grave warning of Quohixima's wrath...\n\nStill, I have yet to find a detailed account of its appearance, or nature.\n\nSomething so intangible and far out of my reach is Quohixima, whose very being is still a mystery to me and all those who study it. Despite being known throughout the world, very little is known about the entity. We may try our best but could anyone name such a formless form? An abstraction of reality... The *most lost* among the lost...\n\nWho could describe the void from which it came, and fathom the terror of its sight? An otherworldly mass of otherworldly horror, a being too strange that just the sight of it can cause madness and pandemonium abound. Only the ancients knew, for they have gazed upon its forbidden form. From the tattered remains of their dead tongue, of which the ancients scrawled upon the marble stone of ruin, could only inscribe the name of the terror.\n\n*\"Quohixima\"...*\n\nThat word... That only word... Only that word...\n\nThat word I cannot seem to grasp, even the people of today have little to no idea of just what kind of calamity Quohixima is. *Many* a sleepless night, quills upon quills upon parchment, the ink ran dry as the scholars tried to derive the meaning of that *dreadful* name. From what the ancients knew, and only what we had learned from them, was that the name of the phenomenon meant pure darkness.\n\nDarkness, of which could cast a shadow on the night's sky. Darker than the blackest black, to make the darkest midnight seem as day in comparison. Ancient text said It came as a cloud, As slow as the rise and fall of the tides, but seemingly from nowhere. The ancient's knew that it comes upon the eve of the new millennium. A time similar to this...\n\nAnd it is for this reason I turned my back upon everything in my life, and why I have journeyed to the ruins of the Aniqotari, to the forbidden continent that lies southwest of home, to the very square of which Quohixima was said to have first appeared. A journey of which has taken years of my life, and the lives of both family and friends.

I hear a noise like none I ever heard before, it beckons me forth...\n\nTo go forth outside to the square... The very square in which the calamity appeared a millennia ago...\n\nI SEE IT! I see it!\n\nIt's coming from the clouds, light has no effect on its form as it makes its descent from the void. It is entirely black, despite the 3 suns shining full upon it. Its size is monstrous, it encompasses the sky as if it's embracing the planet, as like a maiden running to the embrace of her lover.\n\nTendrils upon tendrils, the air is made still as it makes its entrance. I run to the cliffside to get a better look upon its form. It beckons me forth! How could this earthly human language describe the magnitude of such an ephemeral form?

The only discernable feature I can name is of the many eyes upon its mass, the gaze of which all rest upon...\n\nMe...\n\nIt beckons me forth...\n\nHow could anyone describe its sound? An ear-shattering pulse of both high and low tones infinitely spiraling upwards and downwards. The air tastes of its smell, which changes by what seems like the hour.

Technology is the core evil of the Earth and I did everything I could to prevent it disintegrating her delicate, youthful and innocent hands. All she would do was write in her notebooks. She would write secrets that aren\u2019t so secret when I have read them myself. I remember, after that incident when she caught me looking into her mind, she would write notes less and less, her writing fading along with her true sense of self. As I know my daughter and she wouldn\u2019t leave me. I know her and now I know a bit more. That she\u2019s a selfish, self-centred, sorrowful snake to leave with all but a goodbye to her now fading mother. \n\nAnd I know what she would say, that I\u2019m a hypocrite, that I should \u2018look in the mirror\u2019.

The lone remaining office was a filthy closet containing an old computer from 2008. However, when he arrived at his desk, there was only a single sheet of paper with one sentence: \"Please begin the launch.\"\n\nBen looked around for someone to advise him what to do, but everyone was too busy to bother. He didn't want to appear dumb, so he started it himself. When he turned on his computer, he noticed a file called the launch, and Ben shrugged and began the program.\n\nBen's computer began to perform erratically as soon as he double-clicked the file, cycling through various files, strange numbers, and images. A massive, black screen appeared before him, displaying the message \"INITIATING LAUNCH sequence.\" Ben's heart raced as he realized that whatever this file was, he should not have clicked on it.\n\nWhen he tried to close the file, he found that his computer had locked him out. He could only stand there helpless as the countdown proceeded. Ben had an idea with 10 seconds remaining. If he could simply unplug his computer from the wall, he might be able to stop the countdown to whatever was about to occur.\n\nBen attempted to unplug the computer, but it began to beep, causing him to pause. The screen sprung to life, revealing an image of a smiling skull. \"Hello, Ben!\" exclaimed the skull cheerfully. \"I'm your new computer's operating system! I'm here to assist you with all of your computing needs!\"\n\nThe skull continued to speak. \"Don't worry, Ben,\" it reassured him. \"I won't replace your old operating system; rather, I'll work with her to ensure your computer runs smoothly.\"\n\nBen was browsing his new operating system when he spotted something odd. It featured a slew of weird suggestions for him, such as \"bring an umbrella tomorrow, it's going to rain,\" and \"tell Shelly you like her new haircut.\" But it also featured some unusual ones, such as \"become a work genius\" and \"earn millions.\"\n\nBen initially thought the OS was weird, but he saw that the ideas were genuinely helpful. His company was performing better than ever, he'd been making profitable stock market predictions, and his coworkers were suddenly taking notice of him. He was the office's golden boy, all due to an old computer that no one else wanted. After months of unparalleled achievement and attention to his coworkers' needs, his boss called him into her office.\n\nShe informed Ben that she had seen his work and was impressed by what she saw.\n\nBen was overjoyed when his boss informed him that he had been promoted to vice president of financial services. He was only twenty-three, but how could he say no to a six-figure salary and a corner office? His dreams were being fulfilled. As he packed his belongings to relocate to his new corner office, he realized he wouldn't be able to get anywhere without the assistance of the outdated computer he had been given.\n\nBen stayed late at work that night, waiting until everyone had left before sneaking into his old office and unplugging the old computer. He moved it to a basement storage closet and plugged it in, ensuring no one saw him. He figured it would be there for him whenever he needed it.\n\nAt first, the computer's suggestions were personal but helpful and benign. The computer would offer helpful suggestions like \"You should delete your ex-girlfriend's number from your phone\" or \"It might be time to change your password.\" But then it made darker recommendations, such as \"Why don't you choke her the next time you see her?\" or \"Perhaps it would be fun to stab him in the stomach.\" Ben was becoming concerned. He wasn't sure if the computer had been hacked or if it was simply becoming too clever for its own good. In any case, he was no longer at ease with the computer, and he made the decision to erase its memory and start over.\n\nBen was a skeptic who refused to believe in anything he couldn't see or touch, including the supernatural. So when his computer started suggesting that he hurt others, Ben dismissed it as foolishness.\n\nBut then Ben's computer suggested he hurt his boss, and he began to wonder if the computer on which he had come to rely was evil.\n\nHe considered unplugging the computer but remembered how successful he'd been due to its advice. Maybe there was a reason for the computer's suggestions after all? Ben decided to give it another shot and see where it led him.\n\nBen began a covert investigation of his boss based on the advice of his computer. He eventually found out that his boss attempted to frame him for massive fraud. According to the computer, she was a threat to him, and she needed to be confronted.\n\nBen had been feeling unsettled all day. So, when everyone else had left for the day, Ben decided it was time to confront her about it.\n\nThings didn't take long to get heated. They began arguing, and before long, they were shouting at each other. Ben grew so upset that he snatched a paperweight from her desk and smacked her in the head with it, instantly killing her.\n\nRealization began to dawn on him as he stood over her body. He'd just killed his boss, and there was no way he could cover it up.\n\nBen walked down to the storage area, anxious. He'd never killed someone before.  When he reached the storage room, the computer greeted him and instructed him on how to cover up the murder.

Nothing. \\*two more\\*\n\nI am alone in the room and yet I hear many voices. \\*take two more\\*. I hear it again telling me, begging me. Maybe just two more. I do as it tells me. The walls around are melting, yes they're melting to the floor. What reality is this? \\*take it all\\*. What will become of me?\n\n\\*you will become what man was, is, and always will be\u2026an animal. true terror that no god has ever seen, for you will become the god that all vulgar creatures will bow. we are the serpent, this pill is your apple, and you are getting hungry.\\*\n\nMy hand moves not by my doing, but by whatever thing foul or fair above me.

In darkness I screamed until a curious nurse came to inspect. He enters slowly and calls my name. I ambush him from behind the door and slash his throat with the glass. So brutal and so swift was my hand that his last words were left to mere sounds of wind. I close the door to mask the unholy preparations I make for my rampage. The guards notice the trail of blood leading to my room and prepare to breach. They enter and are left in a nauseous confusion as my once white room now a maroon confinement stands shockingly before them. \\*now\\*\n\nI pounce from above and sink my claws into the chest of the strongest man there who fell to my feet\u2026heartless. I take the two on my left by their legs and use them to smash the four on my right. I pummel them all until there is no solid left as I crush the heads of the weaklings fallen at my feet in violent strength. One remains and he stands at the end of the room. I stand stronger, a beast no longer man, covered in fur once black now a deep crimson and I move toward him. The man takes his weapon aimed at me as he shakes at the sight of otherworldly fear. Whatever torture I would have brought upon him will remain unknown as the man turned the weapon on himself while I was only three steps close. \\*now eat, for I have provided\\* I shall.\n\nI exit the room and lay waste to all the poor souls who remained in my godless sight. Floor number one, floor number two, three, four, five, six. Six, six was the medication warehouse. I fill a bag with as many bottles as it can hold. I retreated to my room as advised by the morning star. He instructed me to commit evil so heinous that no one man could destroy it, and to be the bridge between evil of this world and the next. I climb to the top of the asylum and already I see the waves of soldiers entering the gates and at the mere sight of me some begin to cry. The thought of God was unthinkable in a time like this. They assume position below me as I stand mighty above them. I go to take my final bites of the life giving bits of the darkness below, but on the bottle I notice it peeling. I remove the false label and read \u201csugar pills\u201d. I have been in a constant battle with my inner and outer self, and this was the excuse it needed to escape. I knew that my time was up and the voices in my head became muffled as my mind raced toward the end. I decided that no hand will take me other than my own. So I look over the edge of the roof and see my inevitable doom. I close my eyes and take a step.\n\n\\*your doing is now undone, but darkness remains forever. rest now for your time is over, in my cold arms may you suffer for all time. wake again as i cast you back to earth just as i was, and may you continue this pain for as long as pain can be felt\\* I shall.\n\nEvil was the cold hand that gave me the strength to escape my own self, but it cannot save me from this.

A veteran of the First Galactic War, those who served under him knew that he earned the right to be prideful. Cutting an impressive figure, the admiral stood a menacing six foot five and his broad shoulders nearly filled the narrow walkways of the Clarity class shuttle he was standing in. Below him, the planet Accolade grew ever closer. The red-orange clouds that made up the atmosphere swirled as if reaching out like devouring fingers of a faceless beast. Gaise was well aware of the experimental bio weapons that were being tested below and though he didn\u2019t always agree with them, he understood the necessity for galactic projection, especially after the war. The First Galactic War was waged between the United Alliance of Humans and the war-like Azmodian Protectorate. The United Human Alliance consisted of two empires, the Terran Republic and the Earthly Gate Keepers with Gaise belonging to the former empire. Though tensions between humans and Azmodians existed long before Gaise had entered the Naval Academy, he hated them all the same. Part of some twisted propaganda delivered by the Terran Republic. The war was long and brutal, lasting nearly 30 years and spanning much of the known galaxy. The admiral had risen quickly through the ranks due to his unorthodox strategies and outright disregard for the enemy combatants. When the war ended, he was bordering retirement from the Republic Navy and considered moving to Unknown Space to find a tropical beach to live on. He was quickly rerouted and informed of a new threat, one far greater than the Azmodians. To the east of the Alliance territory, defectors of both factions had commandeered their own planet and began to create dissidence within the factions. The called themselves The Freedom Faction and prided themselves on their open views towards all alien species and the desire to coexist in peace with all species. The Alliance was naturally xenophobic preferring to keep their contact with other species limited to minor trade deals and intelligence. Gaise was charged with the inspection and transportation of a new biological weapon that the Terran High Command created to turn the defectors into mindless shells. \n\nAs the shuttle cleared the atmosphere, Gaise\u2019s pilot spoke for the first time since greeting him before they took of from the Behemoth class battleships circling the planet. She informed him that they were 2 minutes from arrival and to prep for landing procedures. Upon arrival, the head scientist escorted Gaise through the catacombs of labs and down to the lowest level in the complex. The admiral stepped out of the lift and into a dimly lit dungeon-style lab. Strange growling noises emanated from each cell and for the first time in his life, he felt uneasy. The scientist, a fellow called Hardy, was droning on about the program. The admiral interrupted him to ask if the weapon was ready for transport, eager to leave this unholy place. Hardy confirmed it was ready and that the material was being loaded into his transport already. Satisfied, Gaise turned heel and walked as quickly as he could to the lift, leaving Hardy standing lost in his own contemplation. \n\nThe uneasy feeling stuck with Gaise until they had left the atmosphere of Accolade gave way to the empty blackness of space. He had always felt more at ease in the massive expanse than on any planet, hence the reason he joined the Navy rather than the Army. His shuttle was received onboard the battleship unceremoniously and he retired to his quarters to mull over their next move. \n\nThat night rendered horrible dreams for Admiral Gaise. He dreamt of the growling sounds on Accolade and his mind created disturbing creatures to match the sounds. He was awoken at 2 in the morning when the loudest growl yet startled him into a sitting position. In the darkness of his cabin he sat deathly still, trying to discern if the growl was in his dreams, or real. Then he heard it again. Followed by a scratching sound down the corridor. Sweaty and dressed in only his standard issue Navy sweatsuit, he slipped his sidearm into the fire position and crept to the door. The scratching appeared to be much closer now, accompanied by sniffing and rasping breaths. Gaise pressed the button to open the door to his cabin, stepping halfway out to take in the view. To his horror he saw his executive officer, or what remained of him, flailing about now that Gaise\u2019s scent filled the area. Only the torso and head remained of Admiral Hayes. Someone, or something had ripped the man clear in half. His skin was a pasty yellow color and bits of flesh dangled from his rotting face. Gaise had only moments to marvel that the man had survived this long with the amount of blood that was surely lost in the attack. Hayes began to pull himself towards Gaise, mouth wide, teeth gnashing together in apparent hunger. But it\u2019s what happened next thet froze Gaise in his tracks.\n\n(Part Two available depending on feedback!)", "ups": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.76}, {"genre": "Fantasy", "title": "Prisoner of Regret", "text": " \n\nI don't remember how it began.

I didn't want it to be.\n\nI woke up the next morning with a hand rubbing my shoulder as I lay on my side. I look to see my grandmother, and I was filled with dread and horror, coming to the quick realization that I was somewhere I wasn't supposed to be, for my grandmother had passed away 4 years ago. She must've noticed my reaction, because she began to calm me down. Even 10 years later, in immediate heart-stopping horror, she knew how to talk to me. As I looked around, I quickly realized I was in my old room at my grandmother's house. It was 7:45 AM, so I reached the conclusion today was a school day. Almost instinctively, as if somebody else as in control of my body, I knew to go downstairs, eat breakfast, and get dressed for the day. The date on the yellow calendar hanging in the kitchen read \"April 7th, 2022\". Eleven years ago.\n\nI don't have even a foggy idea of what happened after that. My head felt like it was spinning as this newly grasped perception of time hit me. Nobody noticed my stumbling, or when I began to break into a cold sweat. For a minute, it felt as if I was dreaming the past 11 years, and this was my reality.\n\nI grabbed my backpack and my laptop and headed for the door, following my grandfather to his car to drive me to school that morning. I put my stuff in the back and got in the front seat. The commute to the school felt so familiar. Roads I hadn't travelled in years flooded my mind like I had driven down them yesterday.\n\nWe pulled up to the school. My grandfather dropped my off, and I went inside the front doors. I don't know how I knew, but I knew 1st period was about to begin and the final bell to start the class would ring in 5 minutes. Yet again, it felt instinctive as I walked toward my class. I felt natural. This is where I was supposed to be. I walked through the door, as a wave of heavy nostalgia flooded my mind, washing out my present day memories like a violent tide on a cluster of seashells. I looked around the room, the faces of my peers remained casual and nonchalant as I suddenly bit back the urge to cry. I walked over to my desk and sat down, which is when I noticed the initials written into the wood. *DM*, they read. Derek Matthews. Next to my initials read another pair, *SB*.\n\nEverything hit me.\n\nMy senses and emotions sharpened as the familiarity of the initials *SB* sunk in almost immediately. My mind lost its balance and fell backwards. I remembered the exact events that are about to take place. I remembered how I was about to feel, how my emotions were going to become painfully unstable. I looked up at the door as *SB* walked in. She sat in the desk next to me, and I knew she noticed how I was staring at her by the confused look she gave me.\n\n\"Hey stranger,\" She spoke.  \n\"Hey,\" I managed to pipe out.\n\nHer expression resolved. The smile she gave me is an image in my mind I would not forget if I lived to be one thousand years old. Her eyes met mine and locked for only a couple of breathtaking seconds. The memory of what I meant to do that day became sharper in my head once more, and I felt as if I was hit by a train at full speed.\n\nI was outside of my body. I watched myself and *SB* look at each other, like time had stopped as if it was meant to punish me. I watched myself shake and tremble, and felt the anxiety and fear radiate off of me.\n\nI began to plead with him. Those pleas turned into begs, and those begs turned into sobs. I raved as I watched him pretend to not pay any attention to *SB*, refusing to ask the question he had been wanting to ask for months. I was screaming now, over his shoulder. Tears were streaming down my face as my heart felt heavy with agony. I raved and yelled, now hitting him. It was of no use, my hands couldn't make contact and my sobs would not - could not - be heard. I watched *SB* get up from her desk, walking over to the door as my former self continued to simply sit there. I was grasping at him, wanting to shake him, but my hands went through him as if he was just air. *SB* was at the door, and I wanted to look away and cover my ears. I couldn't. I was being forced to bear witness as I watched another student get up and walk toward her. I yelled once more, screaming as my knees went weak while they were speaking to each other. I couldn't hear what they were saying, but the next question this student spoke were loud and clear, and split my spirit to its core.\n\nThe second that passed felt like entirety of time itself, as I waited for her response to this question. What I heard next broke me, and brought me to my knees.  \n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe world around me felt like it was collapsing in on itself.

The shard was glowing softly a white as pure as untouched snow, and was cold to the touch. More shards started to lightly fall from the sky, making small thumps and cracks as they touched the ground. \n\nThe family was speechless. They felt confused, anxious, shocked, amazed, and utterly terrified at the same time. They stared in frozen shock as more shards fell from the shattered, crystal sky. That\u2019s when suddenly an odd ash fell on Rina. It ran through her hair, hands, and fingers like warm sand. Rina stood still for several seconds, pondering and trying to organize her overloaded train of thought. Her brain was as twisted and turbulent as a tight knot on a shoelace.

Seeing as the boy's town wasn't even old enough to be charted on most official maps, the closest of those parts available to him would still require possibly a week's worth of travel. \n\nNothing will stand in the way of his magnum opus, however, so bags are packed, the trustiest available steed is chosen, and the robot is given a name to commemorate the occasion. Dot, is what the droid is to be called. Dot is flipped on for the time being, just to record its surroundings and to keep its joints in motion, wouldn't want Dot to rust up in the creators absence. \n\nDot quickly finds a habit of patrolling the town, in one uniform route that Dot had calculated to be the most efficient. Were it not for the help of a few kind residents, Dot\u2019s still new navigation systems would have had him wander off into the woods several times over by now, but it was no trouble to the citizens, who had become fond of Dot and his parrot like audio replays of their own voices. In the following days, Dot noticed changes in his residents behavior. The organics had been altering their regular routine, far fewer of them coming out of their domiciles as often. \n\nDot began to take count of who he saw in certain areas, 4 guards on the perimeter, 3 elderly running the market stands, 12 that come and go from town each morning and afternoon, etc. 4 days after the engineer left to collect Dot\u2019s finishing touches, Dot had counted 2 fewer guardsmen, and the complete absence of the daily caravan. Dot, not having the program to do anything about the situation, kept on his daily routine. The following morning, Dot clocks in a sudden spike of lifeforms, not in the town, but a short distance up and away from it, on the cliffs and mountains that hid his home for so long. Dot took minor detours in his route that day, as the readings from the outsiders was much different than the townies that Dot was all but used to. \n\nThe foreign signals moved in patterns similar to Dot himself, efficient, calculated, and minimal to no sidetracking. That very night, the outside lifeforms vanished from Dot\u2019s radar, along with 5 additional that were not accounted for on Dot\u2019s next patrol. By this point, not even Dot\u2019s parroting could do a thing to return the residents to their normal state of being. This had never failed before, but how was Dot to observe this fact, he was but an unfinished robot. \n\nDot obliviously carries on his route, cataloging no change in population, only in routine. Dot had lost track of nearly every resident of his, before finding the majority of them gathered in the large town hall that rested at the far end of the two street city. The occasional guardsmen leaves the town hall, to return with containers of supplies, presumably to sustain the shelter. The population remained as such for several unbroken days, causing Dot to change his patrol path. Dot now only wandered the perimeter of the town hall, occasionally poking his head through a window to get a count of the remaining citizens. \n\nDot noticed occasional returns in the outsiders' life signatures, coming in from the same mountains and hills at first, and slowly encroaching on the perimeter of the town itself. The signals themselves never stayed but for a fleeting moment, but they always returned for seemingly scheduled check-ins. Night fell, exactly two weeks after his creator's departure. The surrounding lifeforms re-appear all at once, bringing with them the residents that Dot had previously lost track of, very considerate!  \n\nA large gathering of Dot\u2019s regular residents converged with the new visitors, remaining gathered and intermingling amongst themselves for exactly 1 hour and 47 minutes. The visitors departed no later than they arrived, leaving behind the old missing citizens. With everything back in place Dot was able to finally return to his original route, and count the original amount of people in their original places.\n\nNot all returned to normalcy as Dot had initially calculated. The cycle of behavior that Dot had observed and cataloged had been halted, The citizens no longer moved on their daily paths, simply standing in their one designated place, day after night, unbothered by storm or snow. The once traveling caravaneers had awkwardly been parked in the center of the city, the animals dragging the carts eventually wandering off on their own. Months passed, Dot remained faithful to his route, and his once lively city of organics and their shenanigans had become still.\n\nDot\u2019s sensors eventually stopped reading his former residents as lifeforms, something of flesh and blood couldn't possibly be so static for so long, it was simply in-computable.\n\nDot eventually came across an obstruction in his pathing, causing his nav systems to flip him around and mistakenly wander down the path out of town, and into whatever the world had in store for Dot.

It is not likely that I could understand these speeches completely, as my only purpose in this country is to study here. Yet it does not stop me from enjoying my stay.\n\nI enjoyed when the gust crushes my spine, when the coldness wets my socks. These rallies are hours long. Do their speeches mean anything to me? As you can see, the coldness distracts one from the speeches made. I adore bald trees and frosty mornings. I met her at one of these mornings, on a field trip held by a local left-wing group. The harshness of winter drives excitement into my otherwise uneventful life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your friends and family back home?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy fiance is seeking asylum.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he okay?\u201d\n\n\u201c...\u201d, \u201cI hope he will.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a numbing night. She reminds me that I could be very alive, she shares my appreciation of freezing winters. It was when we talked about the mystical, and were realised right in front of our eyes. Men are cursed by their own being, such as belief. In my opinion it is not truth that we care about, but of what we choose to believe. Worship becomes understandable when one looks at the sublime, stars and silent forests. They are infinitely far away. Yet it could be seen. If we can conceive the heavens, how could God not be real? Despite our own mortality, our imagination of the sublime provides agency. My love of winter came from my desire for agency.\n\nI wrote her a poem shortly after the trip. To be honest, it was a piece of shit. It was something about Greek mythology and Bruegel\u2019s paintings. Speaking as the minotaur, as he looks onto Icarus\u2019 fall, while he rots at his own labyrinth. I spoke as I watched her wings burn, but no one really cares about the minotaur, nor do the moth who flew into the fire.\n\nAnother reason why I love winters is because I hate my sweat. Cold weathers are therefore perfect to eliminate these beads of embarrassment. I have a high metabolic rate, my discomfort shows through my sweat. Of all the signs that allow one to read me, my sweat tells the most obvious stories. My sweat melted away any sort of facade I had, melting into the sheets while my ego disappeared in her warmth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cLet me give you what you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I want? Why are you asking that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I love you?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer partner came to the country in September, not an event I am totally fond of. The winter grew harsher, I am not necessarily in love with the pain, but the thought that I might come out of this unscathed. Winter was not an exception for me to skip swimming back when I was in high school. The unheated pool water always pinched and gnawed at me until I was finally awake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I told you I have to leave by 10.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know I cannot stay.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would always tell myself the water is lukewarm, and that I am comfortable suffering the unbearable cold. Swimming usually heats one up, as I was jumping up and down underneath her dormitory on one of the chillier nights. I called her to come down for a cigarette.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cDo you want to grab a cig?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sure, let me ask him first.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is probably the reason why I like winter, because I can tell myself that this cold might not be unbearable after all. I was telling myself the streets were not too cold, that my ultimate goal is to see her, the rest are irrelevant. Who she is with, who she wants to be with, nothing is important compared to seeing her. Despite my confidence in maintaining temperatures, my body never obliges. I would willfully heat up myself to bear this bleeding cold. My nose would irritate from temperature changes and sneezing would become a recurring theme for the day. I detest the bitterness of winter. There are unchangeable things. The pool water would always be at 12 degrees, the breeze would always sting my dried up skin, the nights would always dim at 5 pm. Despite how I tell myself how I enjoy winters, the coldness still remains and there is nothing I could do about it. She is always going to leave by 10, despite how much love she has for you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is denial, my naive rejection of determinism. I remember being asked why I like to suffer, it is because of my sheer confidence that I believe that \u201cI\u201d will not suffer despite the circumstances. \n\n\u2026", "ups": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9}, {"genre": "Romance", "title": "no answer no lover", "text": "She sat in the dark thinking.\n\nShe whatched over him.

Outside of the occasional bird or fish this has been her main sustenance. As she walks she picks a few different fruits for breakfast. She follows the river all the way down the 2 mile path she knows by heart and arrives at the falls. She looks over and sees no bottom, nothin but mist and fog. She looks around, the landscape etched in her memory. Cliffs surround her, and for all but the falls it is a harrowing and impossible fall, no where to climb and no way to jump. She thinks to herself that she could be happy with life above the falls. That she has everything she needs and lives a life of peace, she doesn\u2019t need more.

There was no trace of them, has she always been alone on this island? Do other people exist?

Once one was able to hold her afloat she loaded it up with everything she had and walked with it alongside the river holding it upright with a long stick.

As the kid stumbled, muttered \u201cWell I guess that explains it, then.\u201d As he realized that if the kid hadn\u2019t been there, that arrow would be in his heart.\n\nThe kid coughed, and a stream of red left his mouth. Improbably, he grinned. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s too young to die, it\u2019s you. You haven\u2019t even asked out your crush yet. By any chance, do you have a\u2014\"\n\n\"No, you need a _doctor_, not a button or needle or whatever damn thing you're trying to borrow this time.

He coughed again in the heavy silence. \"So while I'm still in this world, do you mind lending me a pen? I lost\u2014\"\n\n\"Shut up, you bratty kid. Forget whatever dumb, contrived reason you've made up. I've got a charcoal, take it or leave it.\"\n\n\"I'll take it.\" His hand curled around the worn out stick of charcoal. A brief silence.\n\nSuddenly the kid\u2019s wound didn\u2019t seem so terrible anymore. There was blood, yes, but it seemed more like someone else\u2019s blood.

I regret asking what optimism can hurt because right now, I feel like a bullet shot through my heart because there they were standing on my head clear as daylight. \n   \nI\u2019m tired, God; really, I am. Why can I not accept myself like angels or humans? God, do you not understand how it feels to be a demon? People fear demons, and Angels slay demons for sport. They say all creatures created by you have freedom - that's a lie. I feel like freedom is more of a perception than reality. I am weak. I lack the might and strength to live, and for that, I fear my fate will inevitably be hell.  \n       \n My birth was conceived from two fallen angels who defied God's command; from very birth, I was a demon when I was meant to be an angel.\n  \nThe more I thought,  the more  I slowly derailed into despair. So, I went to my happy place- the place where I know it will understand my pain, a broken bridge. This comfortable place helps me recollect myself - it helps to see something else broken like myself.  As I sit on the bridge, my seething rage burns my very spirit into nothing but dust. The more I think, the more I comprehend, and the more I embrace, the more I hate.  God, you never really cared, Huh? You decided that I'm not worth the time to see if I would be like my parents, or would I be as an angel of heaven? I would rather be damned than be one of your mindless soldiers. God, you can be a creator of this world, but I will be the destroyer of this world. Everything you created I will destroy: Every creature: Every Rock: Every Religion: Everything. God, I\u2019m coming home, and when I do, you better be ready for war because I\u2019m bringing hell to you.

She used to love this restaurant. She used to come here before she was with Mark. But had not been here since a long time.

Do you like your food?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good. Tasty-ish.\u201d\n\nMark smiled. They had only been on a few dates. And he was still trying to figure her out fully. He had been attracted to her since day one. But she had been quite distant for the first few months. Not too friendly and occasionally downright cold. Now that he knew her better, he could understand. She had gotten out of a long relationship and didn\u2019t want to jump into something immediately. He had let her know he was interested and waited. He had been content to wait. And eventually it paid off. And they pretty much hit it off immediately. A smile that warmed your heart, beautiful and kind eyes, she was perfect. He didn\u2019t know much about her ex, but he was obviously a thoroughly dumb and stupid fellow to have let her go.\n\n\u201cWe should come here more often. I mean, I like this place.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. We can.\u201d\n\nMark could tell she was a bit distracted though.\n\n\u201cIs something wrong?

You know, from my past life.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Mark\u2019s face fell a little. She didn\u2019t like talking about her ex and he was never overly interested to learn about him either. He occasionally did feel that he was competing with someone he had never seen and it wasn\u2019t a feeling he particularly enjoyed. If it was happening to somebody else, he would have told them to cut their losses and just walk away. But it was Rachel. Even though he hadn\u2019t had the guts to say it loud yet, but he was pretty much hopelessly in love with her.\n\nRachel noticed the sudden shift in tone and looked at Mark. \u201cNo, Mark. I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ve made all these preparations and planned such a great night for us. I shouldn\u2019t be like this. I apologize.

It was almost as if we had an instant connection. He asked me out and I said yes. OMG! I am so excited. He is funny, he is charming and rather handsome too.\n\nDear Diary, OMG what a day it was. It was our 6 months anniversary and I didn't even realize it. But he did. And he planned so many great things for little old me. And his silly little habits are so cute. Like he has this silly habit of finishing words with ish. I asked him how his food was. He said he liked it ... ish. I laughed so much at that. When I asked him if he knew what ish meant, he said, and I quote, \"I dunno. But I like this word. I use it when I really like something or someone. As an example, I like you ... ish.\"\n\nDear Diary, Today I moved in with Robbie. Its amazing. We now have a place of our own! You know I can't help but think that this is the man I will spend my entire life with. I mean he serenaded me with a beautiful song as soon as I entered. And all those flowers. I really do love him. Yes, I do. Maybe too much for my own good. But as the kids these days say, YOLO right.\n\nDear Diary, Robbie has been acting a bit strange recently. I mean I understand the pressure he is under from his work. But he feels just way too distant. And he is drinking much more now. I probably need to talk to him. But at least I can pour my heart to you can't I. You my rhyme buddy diary dear.\n\nDear Diary, Things have been really tough since the past few days. He is drinking way too much and always seems to be irritable and unresponsive. You know sometimes I think he just doesn't care for me. Maybe one day, I'll just walk out the door. Maybe then he'll finally appreciate me more.\n\nDear Diary, I tried. I really did. I went away and didn't pick up his phone for the last 3 days. But I couldn't hold on any longer. I know I promised you that it was enough. I thought I had the strength to do it. But I don't. I relented. I caved in. I hate myself for it. But I love him too much for my own good.\n\nDear Diary, This time its over. For good. No more chances. No more calls, no more messages. I am done. I leave today. I don't even care for my stuff. I just need to get out of here.\n\nRachel realized Mark had been speaking to her as she had been lost in the whirlwind that was her past. She fixed him with a guilty look but he was looking at the lounge singer who was finishing up his song.\n\n\"This guy has an amazing voice, don't you think so Rachel? And the songs. The words. The emotion. I don't even know his name, but I am a fan.\"\n\n\"Hmm... yes, I guess.\"\n\nHe looked curiously at Rachel but didn't say anything. As the singer came down from the stage to take a sip of water, Mark called out to him.\n\n\"Hi there! I just wanted to say that you just made a new fan. I loved that song.\"\n\n\"Do you mind if I sit down. It's really hot up there under the lights.\"\n\n\"Oh sure, please do. I am Mark.\"\n\nThe singer looked at Rachel with a sad smile. \"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hi.\"\n\nMark cut in again. \"As I was just telling Rachel here, I just loved the emotion in your voice. It was most convincing. As if you were telling your life story.\"\n\n\"Not mine.\"\n\n\"Excuse me.\"\n\n\"No, not mine.\" He looked towards Rachel and asked, \"Do you like him?\"\n\nAfter what seemed like eternity, Rachel replied. \"I do ... ish.\"\n\nA couple of tears made their way across her face smudging her mascara a little.\n\n\"I am glad. Mark? Yes, Mark. I am glad you liked it and that I could give you some joy with my singing. Can you do something for me in return?\"\n\n\"What?\" Mark replied uncertainly.\n\n\"Keep her happy. Make sure you give her all the happiness in the world. She has had her share of sadness. Maybe more than her fair share. Do that for me will you.\" He placed a diary he was holding onto in his hand on the table. \"This belongs to you.

Tied to the trunk of a tree. It seems the rope is only 30 feet long. So the man can't wander far from the tree. It's cold out and he's shivering. Based on the frost in his hair, you guess he's been out here at least a day.\n\nYou rush over to him. \"How did this happen?\"\n\n\"I... I don't know. I don't even remember how I got here! Please help me, get me away from Tree!\"\n\nYou go up to him, and you untie the rope from his waist. You're a bit surprised that he couldn't do it himself. But clearly, if he could have, he would have. Nobody wants to be trapped tied to a tree.\n\nThe next few days are normal. But then you walk by the same tree again, and you hear it again! \"Help! Someone please help me. Help me get free of Tree.\"\n\nYou're dumbfounded. The man can't have ended up tied to the tree again? You stop and check and there he is. The rope seems even looser this time. You untie it and you say, \"How did this happen again? Did someone drag you out here again, and tie you to this tree?\"\n\nThe man was relieved to be help, but clearly still distraught, \"I don't know. I don't even remember how I got here?!\"\n\nYou tell him that he should tell the police. That he should lock his doors. And carry a knife with him at all times. And that he should practice rope untying, so that he can get himself out if it ever happens again.\n\nThe next few days are normal, but you hear it again! This time, you're more curious than concerned. Something must be wrong with this man. This must be a scam of some kind. You check for your wallet, maybe he had a buddy come pickpocket you when you rescued him last time. Your wallet is still there.\n\nYou stop on a hill nearby, where you know you can't be seen. And you observe the man. Every now and then he calls for help. Mostly he just sits and weeps. He does try to escape. But \"try\" is a strange word in this case. He tugs on the rope. He gnashes at it with his teeth. But the rope is clearly so loose that if he just shimmied it down to his feet he could step right out of it. Eventually, his screaming gets him another rescuer. And he's off, once more. You don't stick around either.\n\nYou come back a few days later, and sure enough, there he is again! This time, your curiosity goes too deep. So you walk up to him, and without a word, you lift the rope up over his head. He thanks you, and then walks off.\n\nThe next several days, you stake out the hill overlooking the tree. You watch, your curiosity eating you alive. Who's bringing this man out here? Who's tying him to the tree every several days.\n\nYou wait and wait and wait. Eventually, you think that he's not coming back. That he's finally put a stop to whoever was doing this to him. But then you watch, in complete and total shock, as the man walks up to the tree with a rope. And ties himself to it.\n\nYou look with your binoculars. The man walks over, and he almost seems to play with the rope. Dance with it. He seems to like the tree a lot too. You wouldn't say he's having fun, but he's certainly enraptured with the activity. Eventually, by sheer accident. The rope ends up tied around his body, and the trunk. But his dancing continues. You watch, until it starts getting cold, and then you leave.\n\nWhen you return, there he is in the morning. He sees you he shouts! \"Help me! Help me please! I figured out who brought me here. I figured out who keeps doing this to me! Tree did this! Please help me! PLEASE!\" The man is clearly insane, but even worse than that, he's clearly only acting out to mine for sympathy and attention. Enough is enough. You go home and make a sign, which you plant in front of the tree. It reads \"This man tied himself to the tree. He wants to be here! Do not help him!\"\n\nYou walk by everyday. People listen to the sign, cause you can hear him still. Begging for help. Eventually, the cries for help annoy you so much. That you go up to the man, and you untie him. And then, you take the rope, and you throw it into the river. And you say \"never come back to this tree!\"\n\nThe man seems certain, so assured. \"Of course! Of course! I'll avoid the tree. Whatever you think will help me get away.\" And he runs off, as if fleeing from death itself.\n\nThe next day, you walk, and you find the man. There is no rope this time. But he's still stuck to the tree. He begs, he begs for help. You point out, \"there's no rope! You're not even stuck.\"\n\nHe responds, tears in his eyes, desperation in his voice. \"I know there's no rope! I took your advice. But I'm still stuck. Tree put me here. Help me! Please!\"\n\nYou go over there, using the last drop of your sympathy. You reach out to the man, and you pull. But he doesn't budge. He digs in his feet. He screams to be rescued. He begs it to be so. But in his actions, he clings to the tree. You leave him.\n\nThe next day, you come back with an axe. You hand it to him, and you point at the trunk and you tell him to cut the tree down. At first he's obstinate, he claims he doesn't have the will for it. But a few days later, you see him hacking away at it. Chopping at the tree. You're a little proud of him.\n\nEventually you come back, and you see that the tree is knocked over. But the man is still there. Still screaming, still begging, still weeping.\n\nAt this point. It's your mission. So you say \"screw it\". You grab the man, with all your might, and you drag him away from the tree. You drag him to your house. And then you tie a rope around him there. Eventually, you get him some help. You let some doctors look over him. You get him in school. You get him his own place, with a nice job. He never goes back to the tree again, and you don't see him for about that long either.\n\nThen one day, you're at a work party. And you see him again. He's smiling, and laughing. And you think you've really done it. You go over to him, and say, \"hello! How is it like tasting freedom again?\"\n\nYou get close enough, to finally read his nametag. All that time, you never actually picked up his name.\n\nThe nametag reads \"Trei Smith, Consultant.\" Then, you catch his eyes. He looks at you, that same sadness and desperation back in his gaze. He walks over to you and says, \"Help me please. No matter where I go. I cut the rope. I chopped down the tree just like you said. I told the cops. I locked my doors. I've got this job!

She was soaked from head to toe, her hat having been lost to the wind. The tight bun her long dark hair was tied into threatened to follow. She was on the tall side, even for a man, which had caused troubles in the past, but it was a useful trait if a woman was to be captain. Easier to intimidate upstarts that way. Her face, its delicate features on the edge of being worn away by salt-laden winds, was twisted into a dour expression.\n\nThey\u2019d escaped the pirate ship that had been chasing them just barely. Just as the pirate was getting into range of their guns, they\u2019d swung hard in the path of it. A risky move to be sure, but it allowed her men to fire a volley from the deck guns straight into the pirate vessel.\n\nUnfortunately, the captain of that ship must have been born with a vengeful soul. A volley rang out from the pirate vessel as it limped away, badly damaged. Enough holes had been put into her ship to be a problem, but a fixable one on an ordinary day. Curse her rotten luck that a storm had blown in from the south with nary a warning, not an hour after they\u2019d been hit.\n\nWhat patch jobs had been managed were already leaking, and The Whale Chaser was taking on water faster than could be thrown back to the sea. She looked to her helmsman, who had been bound by rope to the helm to keep him steady as he, in turn, sought to keep the ship steady. His face was grim, and lines of concentration lined the man\u2019s tanned and weathered face. She imagined her own face bore a similar look, though that of displeasure rather than concentration.\n\nShe stamped down below to see how the crew was doing at keeping her ship afloat. What she saw filled her heart with dismay. The water was rapidly filling the lower decks as crewmen rushed around with anything that could hold water to try and throw it through the gaps normally reserved for the cannons. Now the only thing being fired out through those holes was seawater.\n\nShe rolled up her sleeves and moved to grab a vessel herself when she heard someone clear their throat behind her. She turned to see a man in a long dark cloak. His hood obscured his face though she could see the light of a cigar from beneath it as smoke billowed out from under the hood. She could see the man was wearing a well-tailored but muted suit underneath. In fact, the more she looked at the man, it seemed his entire existence threatened to wash away with the tide that beat at her ship.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want? If you aren\u2019t going to help move water then throw yourself overboard so we sink slower.\u201d she said viciously, not much in the mood for whatever this passenger had to say.\n\n\u201cOh, I will happily remove myself from your ship before it sinks my dear, however, I do have to ask. Do you want this boat to sink?\u201d he said, the words lilted through the air, gently defying the roar of the waves and shouting of men.\n\nHer face, ever the reflection of her inner thoughts, twisted into a rage as she stomped towards the man. He retreated as she advanced, leading them back to the violent surface of the ship as she shouted, \u201cOf course I don\u2019t want this ship to sink! What captain would willingly throw away her ship, her crew, and her life? You tell me that stranger, now help or don\u2019t!\u201d she shouted at the man. They now stood on the rainswept deck as the ship continued to roll with the tide. She held onto a railing as the man stood square on the deck, seemingly unbothered by the violent shaking of the ship.\n\nAnother cloud of smoke billowed out from under the hood, the cigar staying lit in defiance of the rain. \u201cAnd what makes you think I don\u2019t want to help,\u201d he asked. His voice held a tinge of amusement. \u201cAfter all I came here to offer you a deal my lovely captain. A bargain that would allow you to keep your ship from sinking, that being said you would have to offer me something in exchange.\u201d\n\nShe stared at the man, noticing how he seemed to ignore the roiling sea. How his words cut through the wind without him needing to shout. He stood amidst the storm, the rain striking him but leaving behind no wetness as smoke continued to coil from beneath his hood. And behind the dim light of the cigar, she could see the glow of two unnaturally yellow eyes gleaming with malevolent light.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name sir,\u201d Cassandra asked, shouting to keep her voice above the howling of the wind. \u201cAnd be you man or devil, I have heard tell of such deals, and I would know who and what I am striking such a bargain with.\u201d\n\nThe man laughed, his mirth echoing across the deck. \u201cMy dear, you do amuse me, even in such dire straits you keep your wits about you. Truly I was right to come here for I have little use for those who cannot keep their heads. I can tell you I am neither man nor devil, though like the devil of your delightful fairy tales, I do strike bargains. Though I require nothing so tawdry as a soul.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen what do you require of me, my good not-a-devil?\u201d she asked impetuously. She did not have time for games. Whatever this thing, was it was clearly unnatural. And perhaps a defiance of nature is what she needed. If it could save her ship and crew, she had to at least hear it out.\n\n\u201cI merely require the future of you and your crew, that will be my payment. Now no further questions, that is the deal. If you accept you and your crew will be saved and you may continue your voyage. If you do not or seek to ask another question I will abandon you and your crew to the fate that the sea had bequeathed you. Now what say you my dear?\u201d he asked, his voice carrying the weight of one who knew he had power.\n\nShe stared at him, her face flickering between rage and helplessness as emotions tore at her insides. \u201cI accept your terms,\u201d she said finally.\n\nThe figure that was neither man nor devil dissolved into the wind, and she could hear incredulous shouts from belowdecks. She turned and went down the stairs to see the water retreating from the ship. She continued and watched as the planks grew into place and covered the gaps that once threatened her vessel. Her crew gave thanks to god, some falling to their knees to pray.\n\nShe would allow them their misconception. It was less cruel than the truth. She closed her eyes and begged forgiveness for what she had done. She knew not what the future held, but it must be in that creature\u2019s favor. She could only hope that it was also to the favor of her and her crew.\n\nShe broke her reverie and opened her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s enough of that, miracle or no, there still be a storm on. All hands on deck, the lord helps those who help themselves and we\u2019re to help ourselves out of this storm alive! Now heave to!\u201d she shouted. A loud chorus of enthusiastic \u2018Ayes\u2019 fell upon her ears as she watched her crew spring back into action. She was not deserving of such loyalty, not after what she\u2019d done.

They poked and prodded each other, hurled rocks at passing animals, and acted in general, far below their station.

The Dunkans still held the front, their great lumbering bears seemed to never lack stamina, as they trotted at a quick pace for the last several hours. We could easily feast on the blood of animals when the occasion called. Our party left the carcasses of many rotting beasts behind us, strewn across the path. While it satiated our hunger, we all had a deeper need for something more fulfilling. I hoped for some more humans to share once we reached the village.\n\nThe winding road outstretched before us as we crossed the plains of Gwynedd. At the top of the nearest hill lay the village in question, fortified on all sides by stone walls and a great iron gate. It seemed the reports had been far too modest in terms of what we were up against. In the middle of the village towered a great keep that likely had archers stationed within the battlements.\n\nAs we proceeded down the path, Cian held his hand up, motioning the party to stop.

There were claw and sword marks in the trunks of some oak trees which had been completely toppled. The image of the melee came into my mind, as I attempted to picture just what kind of force had killed two of our brothers.\n\n\u201cLook Rathiel!\u201d Came a familiar high-pitched and urgent tone from behind me.\n\n\u201cLayla, you\u2019re not supposed to be\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHush.\u201d She juggled something around in her hands.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I jumped off my horse to get a closer look.

My eyes narrowed into black slits as I pushed them into focus. It clearly was an ammunition casing of some kind, the make of which I hadn\u2019t seen in many years. From the weight and appearance, it reminded me of the brightsilver that had been used centuries ago in the battles fought for east England. We had been trained about all silver weaponry extensively in classes as children.

I grunted and turned to a wisp of smoke, not caring for professionalism. In an instant, I reached his side with the others, and reappeared.\n\nThere were two horse carcasses in the clearing, bloodied with claw marks and with bite wounds in their neck. This must have been where our brothers were attacked, I reasoned to myself.\n\nThere was a human wagon not far off, toppled over and contents littered all about. Uninteresting books about Christianity, blunt weaponry and jewellery littered the piles.\n\nI heard a sharp HISSSSSS escape one of my companions over my shoulder.

Beside the wagon lay an opened black box. Inside was a silver cross and a rosary that had spilled out. I picked it up in my hands, carefully inspecting the ridges in the craftsmanship.\n\n\u201cWayne, there are no blessings upon this cross.\u201d I said reassuringly.

A blizzard was blowing in, and could be seen on the horizon across the icy tundra. Great, white clouds flowed from the northern scene, soon to blanket the red-stained terrain and cold bodies in the storm\u2019s path. The sea to the north was sloshing with icebergs, and the wind crashed great chunks of ice against each other which cracked and shattered as loud as thunder. A figure moved through the knee-high snow across the tundra, away from a blood-soaked battlefield. The only survivor of the brutal fighting. In his own wake, he left a trail of crimson snow, courtesy of the wound on his torso. He saw the blizzard in the distance, and knew that it would be his death.\n\nHis only salvation would be the mountain to the west of the battle. If he couldn\u2019t climb high enough to avoid the worst of the snowfall, perhaps he could find a cave to shelter in, he thought. Skjold was his name. A name that was given to him by his mother, in hopes that one day he would become a great warrior worthy of a name that meant \u201cshield\u201d. But the blood pouring from his waist made him feel undeserving of it. As many in the harsh northern lands were pressed into service by the numerous warlords, he was made to believe he would return a conquering hero. Instead, fate seemed fit to let him die in the cold tundra. Due to this, a question repeated itself in his mind. Why did he press on? He was hopeless, wounded, near death. He shook off the doubt. Succumbing to despair would kill him faster than the cold. If he was not to survive, he would make every effort to spite fate.\n\nAs Skjold stepped onto the foot of the mountain, the winds picked up whilst he traversed the shallow incline. The softer snow was more difficult to walk on, and the battle had already exhausted him. Above the gray clouds that hanged low in the sky, the sun was already beginning to set. It was still light enough to keep the wolves confined to their lairs, but the light would not last long. As the walk took him further up the mountain, his sweat began to freeze to his face and under his jack as well as inside his socks. His feet were numb. What few chin-hairs he had were beginning to form glassy beads that melted as fast as they froze. Skjold pulled the hood of his thick woolen cloak further down over his head and lifted the collar of his shirt over his nose. His breath thawed his face, even if his posture had to remain awkward as he climbed. It was a grueling hour of walking as the incline slowly increased. The blizzard drew ever closer, but his salvation was within sight. With shivering hands, he crawled up a small outcropping and found himself at the mouth of a small icy cavern. At last! Desperately, Skjold ran into the shelter and collapsed, finally free of the chilling winds.\n\nHe would have seen fit to curl into a ball and wait out the blizzard, warmth finally returning to his hands and feet. But he felt eyes on his back before he could strip off his boots. Deeper inside the cave, he heard a low, quiet growl. Startled, he turned to see a pair of golden eyes in the cave behind him. Beneath the eyes, in the dim shadow of the cave and the waning illumination provided by the darkening sky outside, he saw the white shapes of fangs glistening with saliva. Instinctively, Skjold reached for the axe in his belt and held it high above his head, threateningly. He shouted and growled at the wolf in a vain attempt to scare it away, he was in no shape to fight the predator. Undeterred, it stalked closer to him and pounced, jaws gnashing towards his face.\n\nIt knocked him onto his back, and Skjold wrestled with the creature. In a moment of desperation, he recalled a technique his father told him of. Curling his hand into a fist, he thrusted a punch into the wolf\u2019s mouth and forced his hand into the back of its throat. The animal thrashed and made gagging noises, but he kept his hand in its maw as he struggled to free his axe from the wolf\u2019s weight pinning it to his chest. The wolf stamped its claws onto his wound more than once, and pain shot through Skjold\u2019s body each time. The predator\u2019s breath warmed his hand, and with the return of feeling came pain as he felt its teeth rip the skin from his flesh. Finally, he pulled his axe free and slammed the blunt against his foe\u2019s head. It yelped, and he freed his bloody fist from the wolf\u2019s throat. Taking the axe in both hands, he bludgeoned the creature in the eye, and it went limp atop him. Skjold pushed the unconscious animal off of his body, breathing heavily. He stood, sucking enough air into his tired lungs to release a weak cry of victory. The instant it left his lips, he heard more growls deeper within the tunnel. His stomach sank with dread as he saw more wolves appear from the darkness. In a moment of panic, he yelled at the creatures and threw his axe-- his only weapon-- at the pack. The wolves scurried aside the weapon, giving Skjold enough time to throw himself back out into the snowy mountainside.\n\nThe cold washed over him, and in an adrenaline-fueled frenzy he clawed and tore his way up the sheer rock outcropping the cave led into. When he finally summitted the crag, he fell onto his back as his muscles screamed in pain. His left hand was slicked with blood. More of his precious life flowed from it and froze to his skin. The corners of his vision blurred as the snow continued to fall onto his slowly dying body. With great effort, he pushed himself to his feet. Immediately, the wind whipped into a howl and snow began to batter him. He was too late; the blizzard had arrived. He couldn\u2019t return to the cavern, not unarmed. The sky grew yet darker. It was night, and what light could be salvaged from the moon was snuffed by the massive clouds overhead. Following the incline of the mountain, Skjold continued further up. He clung to no distant childhood memory to keep himself motivated. He had no young sweetheart in his village to keep his aching legs moving. Even the spark of fury in his soul had died out, he felt no motive to spite the gods, or fate. In truth, he did not know why he marched on. An hour later, his vision was blinded by the haze of snowfall. His ears were deafened by the howling of the wind. Darkness of the night shrouded what little he could see.\n\nBut with the darkness, he was able to see something through the snow. A golden glow, hidden amongst the trees and much further up the mountain than he could walk. A camp? A cabin? He did not know, but the spark of hope burned brightest in his heart. He couldn\u2019t die here, not so close to safety! With his muscles burning yet numb at the same time, he shot towards the light as fast as the thick snow could permit him to move. He pulled himself up the incline using tree branches and exposed stones for handholds, but his vision blurred more as he came closer. He saw that the light was a lantern, sitting on the porch of a cabin. With a strained cry of effort, Skjold sprinted uphill and tripped on a stone. He fell face-first into a snow bank, and felt a rush of warmth in his body. Rather than relief, this sensation brought him fear. It meant he was succumbing to the cold. He found no strength in his arms to bring himself to his feet. With his last ounce of will, he crawled through the snow and barely reached the stairs to the porch of the cabin. His will gone, Skjold rested his head onto the stairs of the porch and passed out from the exhaustion of his climb.", "ups": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "Goodnight Sweetheart, Goodnight", "text": "Ugh.

Fleeting memories of his funeral came to mind. It was a closed casket funeral and my parents refused to elaborate on how he died. We all knew it had to have been pretty bad due to everyone's temperaments and lack of details from the family.\n\nMy grandmother mourned his death for a few months. Not leaving her room and constantly sobbing behind the closed door. My mother made it a point to force grandma to eat and shower daily and pretty much lived out of her old bedroom during that time.\n\nThen things seemed to go back to normal, which was a bit odd. Almost as if my grandfather, in her mind, was just off doing errands and would be home by dinner.\n\nOne change that we all started to notice was her ritual of taking the music box and rocking away, on grandpa's rocking chair, outside onto the porch...humming the tune that once played from that old box before grandpa left us for hours on end.\n\nMom said the box was given to her, by my grandfather, when they first became engaged.\n\nThe song was the first song he played on the jukebox at the dinner they would frequent for almost every date after that first time.\n\nI believe it was *Goodnight Sweetheart, Goodnight*.\n\nMom always thought it was a romantic story and was sad that we could never get the box to work for my grandma. Funny enough, my grandma never seemed bothered by it not working.\n\nShe would just keep humming the song and stare off into the woods behind her house. Almost like if she was somewhere far away...maybe in the past?\n\nA couple of years after his death, she was bedridden from Pneumonia and we tried to keep her from being too active due to her not really being able to keep her breath when active. She would almost fall due to being light-headed once her shallow breaths were unable to feed oxygen to her brain.\n\nUnlike the previous time, my mother was unable to stay with grandma due to my youngest brother being born a few months prior.\n\nSo, I volunteered to stay over due to having a break from college and looked after her. During this time, I would set an alarm to wake myself up every 3 hours or so to check up on her. I caught her doing chores while I slept, so ended up being forced to wake up sporadically to ensure the stubborn woman would rest properly.\n\nThe night that she passed, I remembered hearing something that stirred me from a forgotten dream. First thought it was my alarm, but the chime was like a bell or windchime?\n\n*Not digital sounding like my alarm.*\n\nAfter a few moments, I woke up completely as I realized it was the sound of a music box.\n\nI took off to my grandmother's room and upon entering, saw she was not in bed. The music box was gone from its usual spot at the altar. Frantically I tried to follow the sounds of the music box, looking through the house. Clearing the second floor, I made my way to the first floor.\n\nFinally, I was able to approximate the sound was coming from outside.\n\nI headed to the back porch, remembering her old ritual of looking out from her rocking chair. I could hear the rocking of the chair and was relieved that she seemed okay as I opened the screen door to the back.\n\nThe music box playing was, no lie, **INCREDIBLY creepy**.\n\nI figured something might have jarred a part back into place and it started to work for her and I told myself was a great thing!\n\nI called out to my grandma, but she didn't stir.\n\nFinally, I grabbed her shoulder and walked around to meet her face.\n\nThat moment is seared into my brain as a vivid and haunting memory of my grandmother staring out into the foggy night as if before...but she was gone.\n\n*I knew she had died.*\n\nShe had a small smile on her face as if she had seen someone, but no life behind her eyes. She was cold to the touch, so had been dead for a while...but that damn rocking chair kept rocking away, and the sounds of the box played on.\n\nLooked down, and this memory still causes chills ten years later, to see that box wasn't moving at all.\n\nI realized the sound that chimed out came from the foggy woods where my grandmother stared out into. As if right next to me and afar at the very, same time.\n\nThe final chime echoed out into the night as the song finished...and so did the rocking of her chair.\n\nThe hot tears ran down my face from a mix of grief and fear still can be felt as I remember everything to the tune in my car.\n\nWe buried her with the music box.\n\nOn days I visit her grave...when the wind is still and I am alone...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can hear a soft chime of Goodnight Sweetheart Goodnight that seems to echo out from nowhere.", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "The Man In Red (Chapter I) - by Josiah Crocker", "text": "The man in red blew into town on a blustery November day.

One thing everybody agreed on however was the red  velour suit he donned.\n\nEverybody that is, except me. I was there that day. It wasn\u2019t a  particularly pleasant day to begin with. My wife and I were having  troubles and I\u2019d resorted to perusing the windows of local boutiques to  try and find something to, if only temporarily, remove the scorn from  her eyes. It was a heeled pair of brown boots that had me stopped when I  first felt the chill in the air. The wind rolled in from around the  side of the brick corner store I stood gazing into and wrapped around my  legs. I looked down at my feet, a trembling shiver working its way from  my toes up my body. When I looked back up, there he was. The reflection  of him grinning behind me. The first thing I noticed was his body was  red with blood, devoid of skin or any form of containment, the inside of  him turned out like a discarded sock, its seams and frayed strands  baring the inner workings of his construction. It was horrific. As if he  had been burned alive but doused with water after only his fleshy bits  had burned off. He smelled like it too. The second thing I noticed was  despite the depravity that stood in front of me now, I recognized this  man. I knew him, which meant that I knew him standing there now, in  front of me, grinning and bare, was simply not possible. I knew this  because this man was dead \u2013 and I had killed him.\n\nA wide grin splayed across his face, he rested his chin on my  shoulder and stared at me in the reflection of the window. Words bubbled  up from deep within him and fought their way through a blood filled  mouth. Noone will believe you, he whispered in my ear. A hand of melted  flesh and taut tendons wrapped around my other shoulder as he patted me  reassuringly then walked away. He brushed past a portly woman who turned  as he walked by. His eyes twinkled back at her and he gave her a wink  before continuing on down the street. She must have noticed me starting  because when she began walking my way again she said, handsome fella  isn\u2019t he. And that suit. He must not be from around here, he\u2019s dressed  far too nice. She pursed her lips, her cheeks flushed with the  infrequent attention of the male gaze and wandered off to tell her  friends about the handsome new stranger in town.\n\nWhen I turned back he was already rounding the next corner. I took  off after him, skidding around the corner but he was gone. The air was  thick with the smell of burning and a few people along the street were  energetically speaking with one another, each relaying their experience  with the man in red. As I walked from group to group it became clear  from overhead conversations that despite a few details of size and  stature and the general pleasantness of his appearance, nobody had seen  what I saw.

Well, one did, but he is with Lazarus in recovery.\u201d\n\nA warm feeling mixed with sorrow hit me squarely in my chest. To have lost any vampire to a mortal was something that had not happened in recen memory. Usually the dread we struck into the hearts of humans was enough to keep them at bay.

One day you drop a few crumbs on the ground, and before you know it, your house is infested with ants! \n\nHere at Pest-Corp, we pride ourselves on our bug-blasting knowhow. Today, we're gonna give you some handy dandy tips and tricks on how to prevent ant infestations in your household.\n\nTip one: Clean after every meal\n\nEspecially if you\u2019re a parent (kids are dumb, and messy). Nothing attracts ants faster than easy to aquire, freely available food. You're gonna want to look out for crumbs and leftovers as you clean.\n\nTip two: Wipe up spills\n\nThe residue of soft drinks gives off a very strong odor, and is a surefire way to bring ants into your home. Make sure to quickly wipe up any spills to prevent infestation. Additionally, use some disinfectant spray to seal the deal.\n\nTip three: Practise good hygiene\n\nBecause the ants view you as food, the scent that you and your family members give off can quickly attract ants to your location. Make sure that everybody in your house takes daily showers. Additionally, wear deodorant, and brush your teeth frequently. If anyone begins bleeding, wipe it up immediately. Try to keep all bodily odors to a minimum. The smell of tears is quite salty and potent to them, so avoid stress when possible.\n\nHere are some fun games you can play with your family to avoid stress:\n\n-Hide and seek\n\n-Tag\n\n-Chess\n\n-Checkers\n\n\n-Cards\n\n-Charades\n\n-Pictionary\n\n-Twister\n\nTip four: Think twice before inviting over guests\n\nDuring a national emergency, sitting around in lockdown can be very isolating. However, it is important that you do not allow guests into your house unless absolutely necessary. Your guest might have a strong odor, allowing ants to track them. Even if somebody is banging at your door, it\u2019s best not to let them in, and pretend like you\u2019re not home.\n\nTip five: Eliminate lines of sight\n\nAnts have poor vision, but if you\u2019re not careful, they can see you roaming around outdoors, or through the windows of your house. In order to remain undetected by ant swarms, stay indoors. Shut your curtains, close your blinds, or nail blankets to your windows. If you do need to go outside for whatever reason, do it under the cover of night to avoid detection.\n\nTip six: Avoid noise\n    \nIf an ant hears a large amount of commotion coming from your abode, it might prompt them to investigate. Try to avoid arguments, screaming, power tools, etc.  If you know there is a concentration of ants within your area, make a plan with your family to eliminate as much noise as possible.\n\nTip seven: Stockpile supplies\n\nIn the event of a [REDACTED], it will be difficult to find an opportunity to leave your home. Make sure you have supplies you need saved up beforehand, such as:\n\n-Non perishable food items\n\n-Drinking water\n\n-Life straws\n\n-Clothing\n\n-Padlocks \n\n-First aid\n\n-A generator\n\n-Gasoline\n\n-Any kind of chemical freshener to mask your scent, like febreeze. \n\n-Firearms\n\nWhen stocking up, remember that too much is better than too little.\n\n\nTip eight: Incorporate air fresheners into your outfit\n\nYou know those little trees that you hang up in your car? You can actually make necklaces out of them. This is a very easy way to eliminate bodily odor, and it\u2019s also quite fashionable. For added effect, hang them from the ceiling fans in your home. The more unnatural scents in your home, the more protected you are against an infestation.\n\nTip nine: Avoid confrontation\n\nAlthough ants might not appear to be any more dangerous than the average home invader, they most certainly are. They move with incredible speed, and are prepared to devour your flesh. Only use firearms if you absolutely have to, as this creates a ring of noise with a radius of about one mile. If an ant enters your house, the best course of action is to take your family into a room, lock the door, stay away from the windows, and wait for the ant to leave. \n\nTip ten: Know that, in the event of a [REDACTED], your demise is inevitable\n\nIf you stay indoors, you will starve. If you risk leaving, you will eventually be torn to shreds by a mob of ants. One will see you, then alert the rest. You will be ripped limb from limb, mandibles digging into your flesh. When you stop struggling, they will bring you back to their festering hills, and consume you. There can be no hope, only delayal of the end. Know that you are fighting for the moment, and not the future.\n\nThe festering wound that is humanity will heal. Buildings will fall, and hills shall be erected in their place. Ants will pour out into the streets, consuming and purging all in sight. When there is nothing left to consume, they will starve. Nature will once again reach an equilibrium. Civilization will fade, and God's work will be complete. He rests easy, knowing that the innocence and purity of all natural life shall be forever maintained.\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nWe\u2019d like to thank you for taking precious time out of your day to read this guide.

The person I wanted to share every success with passed away unexpectedly when he was 32. It wasn\u2019t just the good things I wanted to share with him though. I wanted to be there with him through everything life had to offer. I believe he felt the same way about me, and he expressed that to me through red Bull. Every day on his way home from work he would stop at the gas station to buy me a red Bull. Every day he would come home, and he would look so proud of himself as he presented me with the can of carbonated caffeine and taurine.

People speak frequently on the pain of unrequited love, but people speak less frequently about the bravery that is unrequited love for a ghost.

It\u2019s base wide, it\u2019s walls tall, it\u2019s peak sharp, and in it\u2019s shadow is where I have built my home. It obstructs my view, taunting my imagination. What would I see were it not there? How endless is the horizon? Does the sun cast the same shadow on those on the other side?\n\nNo one can say for sure, but there are legends, legends of those who have made that climb, legends of those who conquered the mountain, legends of those who live in the sun instead of the shadow, legends of those who have reached the unreachable view.  Many have tried, many have failed, many died doing so, so eventually they stopped, and the legends became just that. Legends. In time people grew content living in the mountain's shadow, and the unreachable view became nothing more than a fool's dream.\n\nBut I could not find peace, I could not rest, I could not abandon the thought, I wanted more, I wanted them to know my legend, I wanted to see the unreachable view. I needed to. Long had I envisioned it, beautiful, magical, a place where the sun illuminated the land instead of casting a shadow upon it. Perhaps I was the fool, but I could not let that stop me, I could feel something missing from my life, something hidden from me, a purpose, one which I could find on the other side of that mountain.\n\nBut so many greater than I had failed, how could I possibly make the climb? No. I couldn\u2019t allow myself to think like that, I had to find my purpose, my happiness, so I prepared myself.\n\nIt was dark when I left, the cool night air struck my skin like thin hairs, I could feel myself form goosebumps as I approached the mountain's mighty foot. It\u2019s base was endless, it stretched for miles like a giant wall, but this was no man made feat. Men create doors, shortcuts, rules, ways to pass through the wall. But this was nature, nature had only one rule: survival. There would be no shortcuts, only one way to reach the top. Climb.  As I prepared myself I made the mistake of looking up, the top of the mountain shot up into the clouds, to a point I could no longer see in the night sky. I hadn\u2019t even begun yet, but I could feel the fear closing in, the doubt, but I couldn\u2019t turn back now, not when I was this close to finally finding my purpose, my peace. I placed my hands along the rocks, I clenched down with my fingers, clinging to the fissures in the rocks, and I began to climb.\n\nWith my feet I pushed upward, using each crack like a step in a ladder. The ground beneath me began to thin as I climbed, the higher I got the less the mountain gave me in return, but I continued onward. My hands started to cramp, and the wind grew colder as I went higher, but step by step I ascended, slowly, but I could feel it now, I had reached the point of no return, and nothing would stop me now. This was the start of my tale, my legend, and before long, I would reach the top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then the rain fell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe water was colder than the air, and the droplets heavy. I could feel my body begin to shake, and my teeth chatter. My grip began to loosen, the rocks no longer provided a safe place for my feet. I could feel myself slip with each step. The water rushed down the rocks, falling straight into my eyes, obstructing my vision. I struggled to make out the top of the mountain, but the clouds were too heavy, it remained hidden from view. I was closer to the top now than I\u2019d ever been before, yet I had never felt further. \n\nMy climb continued, although my body began to lose strength. The rain began to fight harder, my hands began to shrivel and shake from the cold. I could feel the strength draining from them, until I could no longer hold on. One by one my fingers let go of the rock, and my hand fell free. I immediately tightened my grip on the other, but my feet also gave way. I could feel myself sliding downwards, I quickly jammed my feet into the cracks of the wall, and clung for dear life. I felt the fear wash over me, like the rain pouring down on me, my strength had abandoned me, I did not know how much longer I could hug the side of the mountain. Was this to be my fate? Another failed legend?  Another hopeless fool, cursed to forever live in the mountain's shadow?\n\nNo! It couldn\u2019t be, no matter how broken I was I could not allow it. I needed to keep climbing, I needed to reach the top, to find my purpose, my peace, to finally see the unreachable view I had dreamt of all my life. Even if only for a brief moment, I felt a surge of strength flow through me, and I pressed on. The wind howled, it knocked me aside, my wet clothes began weighing down on me, nature was fighting harder, but I still climbed. I could feel the air escaping my lungs, each breath felt more and more painful, my vision began to dull, I squinted, and as I passed through the clouds I could see the peak. Almost there, almost. I need only hold out a little longer, I could see a resting place at the top, a flat level surface, like a perch, that was it, the unreachable view now within reach.\n\nWith the last of my strength I hoisted myself up, I fell over onto the flat surface, and on my belly I crawled out to the edge. I had made it, I had reached the top, and as I crawled forward, exhausted and out of breath I felt finally gazed upon the unreachable view.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd there was nothing but darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rain began to fall even heavier now, with great pain I forced myself back onto my feet.  I scanned the area around me, but it was the same everywhere I looked. No stars, No moon, the sky was empty, even when I looked down below I could no longer see my home, nor the people, nor the lights, there was nothing. \n\nI looked down at my hands and that\u2019s when I noticed the blisters between my skin, the blood leaking out from the wounds. I could see the mud beneath my fingernails, the wear on my shoes, the tears on my clothes, the cuts on my body. Why, why I wondered? Had I not reached it, was this not the unreachable view, the view I longed for?\n\nNot knowing what else to do I screamed into the night, but I received no answer. I was alone, just me, the rain, and the darkness.\n\nAtop that mountain, of which I had dreamed of for so long, I found no legend to call my own, I found no peace, I found no purpose.

That wasn\u2019t what occupied Dale\u2019s mind at the time though. He was more wounded by his gang's readiness to gun him down. The men he considered his brothers no more than three days ago were now trying to take him out of the sky as he fled his past life. The distinct sound of their Buzzer jets told him it was Bill and Bach close behind him. He never liked the two. They were never up to any good, no one was, but the two had a special way of going about it.\n\nDale quickly cleared his mind, the longer he thought of all those men the more this whole situation weighed on him. He locked his jump drive on SPEN-64201, the planet he had planned a homestead with his fianc\u00e9, Diane. His dream was doomed, however. He was dying and Diane- Diane was already dead. As his engines spun up and prepared for the jump Bill and Bach chewed away bits of his ship. He lost them with ease though, once the jump was initiated. The only people who knew about his plan, D, Mark and him were either dead or dying so he didn\u2019t worry about being followed.\n\nHe skipped through the universe like a rock on the water.

He entered the atmosphere with haste, but enough patience to keep his swinger from catching fire. He flew past the northern hemisphere looking for a place to stop, a place to rest his spirit.\n\nHe was getting too low to the ground now. Gravity had more control over the ship than he did. It guided the worn ship into a hill above a clearing which was home to a wandering river. The landing wasn't gentle. The force from the collision acquainted his nose with the dashboard of the ship. Blood now reached from his nose down to his shirt, already dark red with the blood of his previous wounds. Still jumping with adrenaline, he cracked the door to his ship open and fell out.\n\nOver the span of a minute Dale slowly dragged his corpse toward a big tree, must have been hundreds of years old, he thought. There was almost no strength left in his body, just enough to maintain a grasp on conscience, no matter how weak. At this point it was more his spirit pulling him along than his two remaining, functioning limbs. After what felt like an eternity, he slumped what remained of his body against the tree and looked out at the horizon. An evening breeze this far south would have regularly chilled a man to the bone, but it felt pleasant upon his wet skin in his dying moments.\n\nThe weight of his guns didn\u2019t affect his body at all, but he had to get them away from him. With his good hand he removed one, set it on his lap. Then removed the other and proceeded to throw them, one at a time as far as he could. They didn\u2019t make it very far, maybe a yard or two at most. He removed his bandolier then and tossed it aside. He could feel the blood leaving his body and taking his life with it into the ground.\n\nHe dug into his left pocket and produced a pack of cigarettes. He took one out, it was bent, he paid it no mind and set it in his mouth. His hand went back into his pocket and pulled his harmonica out. Not what he had in mind, he looked at the harmonica for a minute though, looking back on all the times he played it while sitting around a fire with D. He set it at his side and reached back into his pocket and this time brought out a lighter which lit his cigarette.\n\nLastly, he reached up slowly with his left hand, removed his hat and set it atop his harmonica, close at his side. His head finally rested against the tree. He took a short drag of his cigarette and took in what a sunset he was before. The clouds along the horizon; all different shades of yellow, orange and pink, the sky directly above, a pale shade of blue and the clearing and surrounding trees, blessed with an amazing orange light. The river reflected the dazzling colors.\n\nDale took the cigarette out of his mouth and pinched it out with his bare hand, he felt nothing now, it was all fading away. He enjoyed his last few breaths of the fresh air. Despite all that he's been through in the past few days, hell, the past few years it was all coming to an end. Here and now as he closed his eyes for the last time, all the pain left his body. The brilliant light of the sunset turned from orange to white. He couldn't open his eyes.

She recalled countless hours she has spent dancing ballet, training and performing. She recalled ups and downs, the struggle and the success she had. She met a lot of interesting people along the way, too; some of them even became her friends. Yes, that was the best part of it. You see, she did not really care for ballet itself all that much. But, it was the one thing she has been doing since a young age, as her mother has been encouraging her to excel at it.\n\nHowever, Alice knew that she was not talented enough to be a professional ballerina, and she was fine with that.

Gilly, on the other hand, prefers to close her eyes when she runs.\n\n\u201cGilly, I really don\u2019t want to get caught\u2026\u201d Gilly rolled her eyes at that one, despite how scared Susy looks as they walk farther away from home. Stealth is not on their side as the mud under their feet sloshes with each step they take.\n\nFinally, Susy stops abruptly with her arms crossed declaring, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be responsible when the guards find out Gilly!\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, this was enough to make Gilly stop in her tracks too, but the look on her face still hasn\u2019t budged. Looking as annoyed as ever, Gilly moves right past what Susy said.\n\n\u201cYou really think they\u2019ll find out with me in charge, Susy?\u201d She rolls her eyes again when she sees Susy look behind her towards the town. \u201cThose guards are just a bunch of fools; they\u2019ll never catch us.\u201d\n\nSusy relaxed a bit and took a deep breath. \u201cOkay... but I\u2019m only going so you aren\u2019t alone.\u201d Gilly smiled in victory and continued to walk off, Susy right at her heels. The sun had finally set, and the girls weaved in and out between the dark shops.\n\nWith Gilly leading the way, the two girls arrive at the back of an apothecary. \u201cOkay Susy, do you know what to do?\u201d Susy nodded her head and crept up to the alley separating the apothecary from the library, using the dark night to hide her shadow.\n\nAs she looked around there seemed to be nobody in sight, but it was hard to tell with the fog growing ever so slightly. As soon as Susy heard the *click* of a lock, she knew Gilly was done. \u201cPst! Get over here, Susy!\u201d Taking one last look, Susy made her way back to Gilly\u2019s side.\n\nAs the two girls crept inside, the smell of sage and burnt paper filled their noses. Luckily there was a mat at the door to dry their muddy feet off. Once they got inside, the two of them reached under their thin, ripped coats and pulled out a satchel.\n\n\u201cWhat did I say, Susy? Nobody in town can do what I just did!\u201d Gilly had that look in her eye again, the one where she\u2019s getting too caught up in herself. As Gilly began to look around like a kid on Christmas morning, Susy searched the display cases up and down.\n\nThe rose-colored cloth under each case made the trinkets inside shine like diamonds. As the rain begins to pick up outside, the noise of their shoes on the hard wood floor seems almost inaudible.\n\n\u201cHey, Susy, get over here.\u201d Susy creeped on over to where Gilly was and looked down into the display case. Her breath stopped short as her eyes gazed upon the most beautiful silk dress she\u2019s ever seen.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can take this out with the rain so heavy, Gilly.\u201d Susy was the only one of the two girls to ever think ahead. It made no difference now as Gilly looked at Susy and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be taking this dress, the rain has never stopped me before.\u201d\n\nSusy knew in that moment that nothing had changed, Gilly is too arrogant to look at the cold hard facts of a situation. So, with one swift movement, Susy positioned herself between Gilly and the case. \u201cSusy, you know better than that.\u201d Gilly pushes Susy to the side, almost knocking her into the glass cabinet behind them.\n\nThe chime of the grandfather clock sent a chill down both of their spines, finally acknowledging how late it truly was. The bite the cold water left on their skin was no match for the stare the two girls shared with each other.\n\nAs Susy reclaimed herself her eyes burned into Gilly\u2019s, speaking more words than either of them has said the entire night. Their emotions began to blind the girls, fogging their hearts the same as the rain outside fogged the windows.\n\nAs Susy reclaims herself, she looks up at Gilly, the expression on her face the opposite of the timid girl she was before sunset. Susy looks over her shoulder, realizing her satchel was ripped in the fall.\n\nShaking her head, she turns her back towards Gilly. The water dripping from her hair making her look like a different person.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t play part in your games anymore.\u201d Gilly, trying to cover the look of defeat on her face, mutters one last breath to Susy. \u201cLet\u2019s see how far you make it without me.\u201d\n\nBefore either of them can process what happens next, Susy steps outside in that bitter night to find that neither of them will be going home.", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.73}, {"genre": "Fantasy", "title": "The Sword and The Son", "text": "\n\nThe clearing was dark as the new day sun had only just began to rise.

You did it!\u201d said the younger of the two men. \n\n\u201cNo Kurt\u201d, said the the older man, \u201cWe did it.\u201d\n\nAs the two adventurers entered, they continued toward the middle of the clearing where they came upon a large stone sitting perfectly in the center. Jutting out of the top of the stone appeared to be the handle of an ancient stone. On the handle was an engraving of a language long forgotten. \n\n\u201cSo this is it?\u201d asked Kurt. \u201cThis is what you\u2019ve been looking for?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes son\u201d began the old man \u201cthis is what I have been looking for my entire life. The sword in the stone. It\u2019s said that this very sword is what inspired Arthurian legend. And just like the legend, only the most good and pure of heart can free it from its stony prison.\u201d\n\nAs he finished his explanation, the old man knelt down next the stone and placed his weathered hands on the hilt of the sword and began to pull. The sword did not yield. The man smiled as he looked back up at a surprised Kurt. \n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201d exclaimed the young man. \u201cWho could be more worthy than the man who has used his wealth and influence for philanthropy? The man who took me in after my parents accident? You have more than proved yourself to be good!\u201d\n\n\u201cKurt, it\u2019s true that I have tried my best to do good, but I have made terrible decisions that just can\u2019t be undone\u201d, explained the old man. \u201c But, taking you in was the best thing I could have done. Finding the sword was not my only life\u2019s work. It was raising you to become a good and decent man. I never had kids of my own but you are my son Kurt and we are here today so that you can fulfill my work.\u201d\n\nKurt looked back at his surrogate father stunned. \n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u201d\n\n\u201cI do, son\u201d \n\nKurt took a step forward to hug the old man, and then he took another step toward the sword. He placed his strong, youthful hands over the hilt and began to pull. The sword started to release! In just a few seconds the sword was free and in Kurt\u2019s hands. He could not believe it as he stared at the ancient weapon in disbelief. Suddenly a power started to flow through him. The old man had said nothing about this! \n\n\u201cHow does it feel son?\u201d\n\n\u201cIncredible! I feel like I could anything\u201d\n\n\u201cThe legend says that the sword grants its wielder with immense power, this is the reason I have sought after it. I believe that it could help me rid this world of evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you really think think it could do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I do, if I didn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t have wasted this much time.\u201d\n\nHolding the sword Kurt\u2019s strength, speed and reflexes were heightened to the level of a superhuman.

The old man now felt the same awesome power his adopted son felt moments ago. \n\n\u201cSon, I wasn\u2019t entirely honest with you. I\u2019ve been here before and the sword has denied me before.

He would eat a freeze dried cube of meat, an electric pulse would cross the frontal cortex of his brain, this would release chemicals through out his body. As a result he would step off the side of a bridge. \n\nOne year before, Frank received sage advice from a homeless man. \n\n\"Listen closely, Bud\". Undeterred by the mistake in name, Frank listened in closely. \n\"If you work four subsubsistance jobs, you can make subsistance compensation.\" To make clear the value of the advice given, the homeless man immediately stopped living. \n\nFrank pressed his foot in to the anti homeless spike next to the homeless man's dead head. He realised in that moment he had the cheat code. \n\nThe bridge Frank would later step off had been decorated with photos of families. Everyone was happy in the photographs. The ice-creams they held would never melt. Signs that said \"You are loved!\" were stuck next to signs that said \"Mind the step\". These only seemed to encourage the chemicals in the body to spread.\n\nThree months after the homeless man had ceremoniously died, Frank had placed a deposit on a 15 square meter flat. The cheat code worked. \n\nGreedily he took a fifth job. The opportunity came after his fourth job's line manager had passed away between shifts. Frank was able to take his second job. Did other people know about the cheat code? 2421 homeless people die each day. Was the cheat code shared 2421 times each day? Frank was worried. \"Will they kill my chance?\" \n\nNevertheless, cheat code in hand, Frank's luck continued to grow. Four months after the homeless man died, Frank was hit by a policemans truncheon, knocking him unconscious. The newspapers reported that he had been struck by a rock, thrown by striking workers. Frank met the mayor later that day. The mayor's assistant handed him an envelope with one month's worth of food stamps and a coupon for a dentist check up. \n\nFive months after the death of the homeless man, Frank was layed off by his third job.

Frank didn't know who Michelangelo David was. No sweat, there was time yet to get the money to remove the tooth. \n\nFour months passed with no incident. Pills had him fitter, pills had him healthier, pills had him more productive. There was bleeding, but when wasn't there. \n\nFrank's second job presented an unpassable opportunity.

The garage door closes behind it as I drive through the apartment complex and onto one of the side roads. It was near midnight, and a storm was moving east. I turned east, knowing the roads I would take well. It was the first time in a long time, nearly a year since I had made one of these drives. Family was staying in my small apartment and the needs of work required me to stay up all night, something I couldn\u2019t do without disturbing my guests.\u00a0\n\nThe air was still warm and sticky, but the air conditioning was kicking in as I stopped at a light on one of the main roads. I waited for it to change, then I took to the side roads to slip around the side of the town. Illumination from street lamps drifted lazily through the sunroof and windows of my economy grocery-getter as I rejoined a road I had taken and a hundred dozen times before. This junction didn\u2019t mean much. I was still in the town and it was only natural that I had been down this road before. I stayed silent as my radio played off my aging ipod quietly. I didn\u2019t look at the speedometer as I let the car cruise at a natural place. For a time, my mind was blank of all except for the task of driving. This was my meditation. A reset. A few moments alone where I could gather my thoughts and reflect on myself in inner peace. It wasn\u2019t that my family or even my life was stressing me out, life was good compared to twelve months ago. A man simply needs a little time to himself to be alone.\n\nI made another turn at another light, clipping through on a yellow to turn onto the highway heading east. Nights like this always took me back in time, but the nostalgia hadn\u2019t hit me yet. I was still on the well-known roads of my home town and not yet to my destination. I crossed the Little Muddy and turned my head to the left to see the twinkling of the town lights before I passed the Haliburton and Red River yards and crossed the bridge over the train tack. As the car climbed the hill out of the town and the buildings grew further apart, I couldn\u2019t help thinking back to how many times I had to take this road, not for indulgence, but for obligation. I pushed those thoughts out of my head. The location and timing weren\u2019t correct. For now, I focussed on the road and the increasing rain as I caught up to the storm.\n\nI did my best to focus only on the road and the radio as I drove down the highway. It wouldn\u2019t be much longer now. I passed county road eleven and thought back even further to hot summer days years before when I had worked for the county. I was close now. The only hint that I had reached my destination was a black oil pad and the light of a farm-house porch a quarter mile down a dirt road. I glanced at the clock on the dashboard as I continued down the highway. It was twelve-thirty now, and I felt comfortable. I may have been in my near-silent economy car, but now I could remember back three years to my first real oilfield job, running the eight twenty-one route. I could almost hear the exhaust roar of my old and beaten work truck. I could feel its uncomfortable seats, and I could feel that old feeling of having completed my middle run and being on the return leg to the P-Evitt disposal.\u00a0\n\nI had run that route a hundred dozen times in the year that I was assigned to it. It was my safe space. Six disposals across twenty or so county roads and a highway. Six sites I was responsible for, that gave me pride and built up the career I still had. I fancied I could feel the ruts worn into the tarmac from my work truck as my car glided through the sheets of rain, creating a mirror sheen on the two-year-old blacktop. I relaxed as I followed the road, letting the memories of those times wash over me. I passed by a crossroad, and remembered the half dozen times I had taken it to avoid potholes and road work, thinking of the Bowling for Soup song that always seemed to play when I did my mid run down it. But on I drove. I passed a farmhouse and its barn, ringed by trees with the highway running through its yard. I flipped on my turn signal and trundled onto highway forty-two, the lights of a disposal I knew nothing about filling my rearview as I dropped down the first hill towards the cooly.\u00a0\n\nThe car flowed down into the dip and dropped on for endless hours, or so it seemed. I had been down this road two, it was the way from the P-Paulson and P-Evans to the P-Thomas. Part of the old route. I skipped a song on my ipod to one that I would have heard on this road. I couldn\u2019t help but think back. My old company truck was at the apartment, registered in my wife\u2019s name and retired to the leisure of being a daily driver, no longer seeing the miles or the dirt roads or the rushes to various emergencies. A fitting life for a loyal companion. A truck I loved as if I had bought it new and put all of its hundred sixty thousand miles on it. The truck was gone from the company, I was gone from the company, my best friend was gone from them as well, and none of us had run the route in years. How things change.\u00a0\n\nThe car rose up the other side of the valley and the lights of the Pankowski came into sight. It wasn\u2019t one of my disposals, and I remember when they installed it, it wasn\u2019t even managed by the company that contracted my employer, but my employer did have workers on it. I never met them, never spoke to them, but was under the impression that my P-Thomas handled overflow from the Pankowski when it was down, and that was quite often. It took everything in me not to turn left at the Pankowski and cruise down county road fifteen to the lease road leading to P-Thomas. But, I was in my Hyundai and not in my company truck, and I was not with Celestial Oil Services anymore, and I was not on the eight twenty-one anymore, though part of me always would be. I traveled another mile up the road and pulled into a field access and stopped the car.\u00a0\n\nThe clouds of the storm lingered and the night was black, but from my perch on the top of the hill, I could see for miles, across a plane and down to the lake, including the distorted light of the P-Thomas. Though the night was black, the plane twinkled with manmade constellations, oil flares and site lights lit up the ground as beautiful as any star-speckled sky. I was never an astronomer, I could only name three constellations, but below me was a cosmos I had sailed through and knew like my own backyard. For one night, for a few hours, once more, I was king of my domain, a monarch ruling six saltwater disposals over twenty miles of road, lord of changing filters, duke of sending reports, baron of cleaning triplex pumps. Home at last.

Yes, I know it won\u2019t make complete sense at first, you will experience a little bit of confusion as your mind attempts to piece together the memories it\u2019s lost, but that\u2019s quite normal, don\u2019t dwell on it, the key thing is that you don\u2019t remember what you don\u2019t remember, right?

That\u2019s quite alright, my name\u2019s Dr. Alan Saudade and\u2026 Don\u2019t worry, I know your name, but it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you again. So, it\u2019s been a while, I know, but you don\u2019t recall your last procedure? No, no, that\u2019s a good thing, I just thought I left a little bit in. You don\u2019t remember?\n\nWell, ordinarily, we remove the experience of the procedure itself to avoid the question of why it took place to begin with. We find that question often leads patients to ask what memory they wanted to remove which ultimately leads them to rediscover the unwanted memory again. So, for good measure, we leave that bit out. \n\nThen why did I\u2026? Well. That\u2019s a good question, I left you with some memory of the procedure, because, in your case\u2026 You see we don\u2019t normally recommend this number of removals. How can I explain\u2026?\n\nMost people like to imagine the mind as a computer. They think that memories are like files that can simply be deleted. But the brain, your mind, is infinitely more complex. There\u2019s no perfect analogy, but it\u2019s much closer to a web and every intersection on the web isn\u2019t an idea but represents the atom of an idea. Connect enough of those atoms together and when they\u2019re stimulated together, you have what you would call an idea or a feeling or a memory.\n\nDo you follow? You see, every single one of those ideas is connected to each other in ways that might never be fully realised. One neuron might be used to think a million different thoughts. And the thoughts themselves aren\u2019t preserved perfectly in the mind. The memory only exists when it is remembered. And in remembering, connections are strengthened, others are weakened, the memory is permanently changed. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re right, my point. My point is that although we do use computers, the portrait chip only *maps* your neurons. When I go in and create new connections, severing others, it\u2019s not a digital change, but a physical one. And there\u2019s only so much physical change of this nature that is healthy.\n\nNo, no, we never promised that, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. All we do is reroute the connections so that not every thought will lead back to the unwanted one. That\u2019s all we can ever do.\n\nI know, I know, but listen to me. I can never completely remove that memory, it will always be with you and if your mind finds a new path there, then... I know. I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t change what happened. I can only do my bit to help, the rest is up to you.\n\nI\u2019ll perform one more procedure, but I won\u2019t remove this conversation, do you understand? That way I hope you\u2019ll remember that this isn\u2019t the only help you can get. You can\u2019t fix a complex problem with a simple solution. I\u2019ve helped you all I can.

He scanned down the list. 76% nitrogen\u2026 23% oxygen\u2026 and a negligible amount of helium. Hemmer\u2019s heart sank. \u201cNo problem after all,\u201d he told the computer routinely, scowling disappointedly. \n\n*Well, there is a problem. The ship\u2019s measurement systems are broken, and the only thing that let us know was an antique show.* Hemmer nodded, but it didn\u2019t seem to comfort him. \n\n\u201cYou know, 9593, I really thought we had something there.\u201d The side of his mouth twitched in frustration. \u201cWe almost had something good.\u201d\n\n*You mean something bad*. \n\n\u201cSomething different!\u201d He snapped, in an unusual burst of emotion. 9593 paused for a moment. \n\n*You have plenty of things to do. The entirety of our civilization\u2019s surviving media is at your fingertips. There\u2019s enough old films alone to last a lifetime.*\n\n\u201cWhy would I want them to?\u201d He said again, more in despair than in anger. The computer had no answer. Hemmer sat down and rested his head on his elbow.  \n *I\u2019ve been watching them, even if you haven\u2019t*. \n\n\u201cYou have?\u201d He said, disinterested.  \n *I have*.\n\n\u201cWhich ones?\u201d\n\n*There\u2019s one called \u201cBack to the Future.\u201d It was incredibly popular some six thousand years ago -- one of the oldest in our collection.*\n\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d the doctor replied, clearly not fascinated.\n\n*You don\u2019t find the irony at least a little funny? That I\u2019m watching a movie about going back in time thirty years, that itself is two hundred times that age?*\n\n\u201cMhm.\u201d\n\nThe two of them went about the rest of their day hardly speaking. The doctor spent the afternoon reading a mystery novel (the tenth time he had read it, 9593 noted). He ate a standard dinner, and turned off the lights and went to bed at an abnormally early eight o\u2019clock. The stars were once again visible outside the window. 9593 couldn\u2019t help but wonder at the futility of their mission. The likelihood of stumbling across a habitable planet before Hemmer passed away was astoundingly low. And then what fate for the computer? What fate for the ship? It sighed metallically. The only movement on board was the slow rise and fall of the scientist\u2019s chest, and the air from his lips rustling his long grey beard.\n\nDr. Hemmer had a dream, but he didn\u2019t remember it upon waking. He pulled on a new button-up shirt and a new pair of khakis and trudged over to the table across the room. \n\n*How are you doing, Dr. Hemmer?* 9593 said as the doctor poured milk into his bowl. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing alright,\u201d he responded with a neutral expression. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\n*I\u2019ve composed a poem, Dr. Hemmer*. The old scientist looked up from his cereal at the green light on the wall. His eyebrows furrowed.\n\n\u201cYou have.\u201d It was more of a statement than a question.\n\n*Do you want to hear it?* The doctor nodded, his puzzled expression not leaving his face. *Here goes.* The robot cleared its electric throat. \n\n*The sun shone down on her pink-cheeked face,*\n\n*And warmed without a care.*\n\n*And none could see, if given chance she,*\n\n*Would sit forever there.*\n\nThe scientist smiled, pleasantly surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s actually really good, 9593.\u201d  \n *Really?* There was a tinge of excitement in the monotone voice. Dr Hemmer nodded.\n\n\u201cReally.\u201d", "ups": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "Knocking", "text": "Some summer days are too wrought with time. The kind of time where you \\*have\\* to think of something to do, and today, I was knocking around the house just trying to pass the time. I even found myself standing at the kitchen window, totally zoned-out and simply watching my mother out in the garden. Eventually I found myself sitting at the table with a drawing pad- figured I\u2019d try and exercise my creative muscles. It was hard to keep my brain and hand from just stopping and remaining still, so I resolved to turn on the radio. The only thing that served to do, however, was inspire me to rap my hands and tap my feet. Restlessness had become me, and I had to just get up and move. After moving to the sink, I began tapping my knuckles lightly in tune with the song on the radio, and as the song reached its crescendo, I matched it with one hearty knock of my knuckles. In that moment, I began to feel a bit more relaxed, a bit calmer. Perhaps now I would finally be able to start being productive, back to the table.\n\nBut then, the moment my back was turned I heard it, a knock. I glanced down at my hands, my feet. I didn\u2019t make that sound, but the knock I heard was the same pitch, length, it had the same punchy sound my musical knock was. It had startled me so that I had to turn down the radio. I surveyed the kitchen windows- no one was there, no birds, no dogs. I figured it must have been the front door, but to my dismay, when I opened it, there was no one there. So I popped off the back porch to ask my mother why she knocked on the door, what she needed. Evidently nothing as she had not left her spot in the garden, and my question only confused her.\n\nBack inside I was left without conclusion - I heard a knock, but there was no perpetrator. So back to the table I went to try drawing again. I turned the music back on from the radio and my eyes fell down to my paper and work began. Thankfully I was able to get some ideas down on paper- I think the music really helped. I found myself once again tapping along when my pen was down\u2026**tap, tap, tap, tap.** Unbeknownst to me the radio\u2019s battery was dwindling down, and then it simply died. In the silence that filled the space, I heard it\u2026 tap, tap, tap, tap. There is was again, just like before- there was an echo to the sounds I was making. I brought my hands up to my face. I had to make sure the sound wasn\u2019t coming from me, even subconsciously- I lifted my feet. The windows were still clear. Where the hell were these noises coming from?\n\nBefore I knew it I was tapping my fingers again, t-t-t-t-tap. I hadn\u2019t even realized it- must have been out of nervousness. Once I caught on, I stopped. But there it was again- **t-t-t-t-tap.** Was it coming from\u2026 the floors, the walls? This echo, if it truly was one, was beginning to induce some sort of mania in me. I wasn\u2019t sure where its origins were, and almost without thinking I swiftly knocked my hand on the table- BOOM BOOM. It echoed back- **BOOM BOOM**\\- instantaneously.\n\nI gently wrapped my knuckles on the table- brr- **brr** in return. There is something echoing me, there was no way to deny it. But where the hell were these noises coming from? It was too loud and too clear to be coming from the floor, so I ran up to the wall, and I knocked once more. 7 times, loudly, softly, quickly, slowly. And it all came back to me, from the wall.\n\nI froze- confused and afraid. Then, from the wall, there inexplicably came a firm and deliberate **knock-knock-knock**. Whatever was producing the sound was now brazenly going first. How did it know to do that? Can it see me? Why is it doing this? My hand shook as I laid it upon the wall and delivered my own knock-knock-knock. The air was heavy and thick with the presence of nervousness.\n\n**Tick-tick-tick-knock-tap-tap-knock.** Tick-tick-tick-knock-tap-tap-knock. And then the sound moved, downward. **Tap-tap-tap-BOOM.** From the vent at the floor this time. **Tap-tap-tap-BOOM**. Somehow, then, the vent rattled.\n\nSlowly a thin, white whip of smoke emerged from the vent. I raised my head parallel with its movements upward towards the ceiling. I held my breath as it gently lowered itself and graced me with its presence. The whip angelically swarmed around my upper body- warm and ethereal. I extended my arm and its smooth contours wrapped around and extended off of me. Behind it, it left a warm- almost glowing- sensation on my skin. It flowed through the air, contracting and extending as it discovered the dimensions of the kitchen, and then it seemed to settle. I froze, only my eyes being able to follow it. On the table where I was working it rested, only for a moment, and then it seemed to materialize a form. The smoke directed the movement of my sketchbook, lightly flipping over a page. As well it picked up a pen and began to write. When I could finally break myself from my stasis, I slowly approached to see what was written.\n\n\u201cThank you\u201d\n\nA flurry of breaths came out of me as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing. What is it thanking me for? Was it stuck in the wall? But\u2026 its gratitude filled me with warmth, and the white whip of smoke moved into the noon-day light coming from the window. It floated like an angel, the light glittering on its form. I need to show someone. I ran to the porch to signal mother inside.\n\nMother must have sensed the urgency in my voice, and she hurried from the garden into the house, leaving the door open behind her. As soon as she stepped into the house she saw the beautiful smoke, her eyes followed it as it spun and floated towards her. She stuttered with disbelief, but her eyes were bright and a smile grew. I\u2019m not the only one who can see this! It felt as though we were stuck in time with this hypnotic glowing force, then it made it to mother. Slowly it descended upon her. Gracefully it slid from atop her head downward. It lay softly upon her shoulders.\n\nIt then wrenched tight around her throat. Mother fell to the ground. The smoked creeped out the open door.\n\n\u2026\n\nMother hasn\u2019t woken up, and I don\u2019t think she will. I keep trying to check if she has a pulse, but my hands are shaking so violently. I don\u2019t know who to tell, I don\u2019t even know how to explain what happened. But what I do know is that thing is out there now.

They kept walking very reluctantly.\n\nAfter 5 more minutes of walking they came across a 3 way intersection.\n\n\u201cWhich way? Left or Right?

Normally, only a single Bokken is used in sword-fighting. However, Lin and Saito are armed with two wooden swords in both hands.\n\nEven before the Nuclear War, dual-wielding was rarely practiced by the ancestors of the *Sonjenese* swordsmen. So seeing a clan practice such a technique is very rare.\n\nNevertheless, the Shadow Leader needs the Harashi Clan dead. By eliminating Harashi Saito and his entire extended family, only **one** political super-power will remain.\n\nThe shadow locked his eyes on Lin, a beautiful girl with pale skin and a petite frame.

Yan\u2019s robotic dog wagged its metal wire tail and barked playfully.\n\nThis time, Lin charges in. She parries Harashi\u2019s *Bokken* with a heavy slice then transitions to an overhead slash. Harashi blocks the attack, pushing Lin back with both weapons, knocking her down again.\n\nThis time, Lin gets up, gripping her \u2018swords\u2019 even tighter. She proceeds to strike overhead, quickly transitioning to a combination of several slashes from every direction.\n\nWith a swift movement of his weapon, Harashi delivers a heavy upward strike. Lin blocks the attack but her incorrect footing causes her to slip and fall down on the floor.\n\nHarashi goes back to a formal stance as Lin lifts herself back up.\n\nKnowing the training is over, she bows down as a sign of respect, prompting Harashi to do the same. After that, Lin hugs her dad and gives him a sweet smile.\n\nThe three proceeded to eat dinner. Yan is munching on *tempura* while Lin is chewing on *sushi*.\n\nLin turns to look at her younger sister.

They had swept over everything in their path, and wouldn\u2019t rest until the last free city had fallen to their master. \n\nGeneral Cadd and his forces were surrounded, their backs up against the wall of the mountain. And among the host of the enemy, I could see *them* circling in the air.

I had no idea. Was it normal for humans to be able to merge their consciousness with a dragon? No clue about that either. But then again, I\u2019m not one to question the deeper mysteries. All I know is that I belong to Nax, and Nax belongs to me. And she is this world\u2019s last hope.\n\nThe general knew it too as he emerged from his tent to meet her. I could sense his desperation. The camp reeked of it. I didn\u2019t listen in to their conversation, my focus was elsewhere. My eyes scanned the horizon, trying to ignore the stares of the soldiers craning their necks at me as they hurried by. Most had never seen a dragon before that wasn\u2019t trying to kill or eat them.

He was shoved down onto a steel chair as the sound of the chair scraping against the tiled floor echoed throughout the small room. Above him was a single light bulb and in front of him was a silver metal table. Across the table from the prisoner was his captor.\n\nThe captor was in his dark green uniform and by the look of the insignia on his arms, he must\u2019ve been an officer of some sort. He was leaning forward, his elbows resting on the steel table. Paperwork was in a neat pile in front of him.\n\nThe captor looked tired. His uniform was unkempt and his beard was long. His eyes were worn out.\n\n\u201cYour name is Devlin, yes?\u201d the captor asked in a strong but understandable accent.\n\nThe prisoner didn\u2019t answer. \n\nThe captor sighed. He slowly got up and walked around the table. He placed a cigarette in the prisoner\u2019s mouth and lit it. The prisoner took a deep breath and puffed the smoke out of the side of his mouth. The captor then leaned down and uncuffed the prisoner. \n\n\u201cDevlin, you\u2019re free to go.\u201d \n\nDevlin took another drag of his cigarette and leaned back in his chair. \u201cSo, I guess the war is over then?\u201d he asked calmly.\n\n\u201cNo, not yet. But it looks like we have reached a point of inevitability.\u201d \n\nDevlin had no reaction. He continued to smoke his cigarette. \n\nThe captor sat back in his chair and removed his hat. \u201cYou have been here with us for over six months. We have deliberately kept news of the outside world from you. Now, this will take some time, but let me explain what has happened. Six months ago \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are my men?\u201d Devlin interrupted.\n\n\u201cSir, I\u2019m trying to explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cExplain to me where my men are.\u201d\n\nThe captor looked down. \u201cThey are all gone, believed dead.\u201d\n\nDevlin stared straight at the wall behind the captor.\n\n\u201cAbout a year ago I was stationed here. This was an enviable posting. We were to protect the northern border but no invading force had been able to cross those mountains in over one thousand years. Some of the men were eager for action but me, I had already seen enough.\n\n\u201cWe had six months of no activity. We then received word that there was some movement in the mountains. I personally thought it was some bad intelligence but we sent a scouting force out anyway. And that\u2019s when we heard that an entire division was moving towards us. \n\n\u201cSo we moved out, ready for an ambush. We carefully laid our trap and that\u2019s when we saw your army. We heard you from miles away and when we saw you, if I\u2019m being honest, it was a sorry sight.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what had happened but I assumed the arduous crossing had really taken a toll on your men. But you were a hostile enemy combatant. And we had our orders.\n\n\u201cThe rest of that encounter you are familiar with. We took your men and you, Colonel, were sequestered somewhere else. \n\n\u201cYour men were treated fairly I assure you. We fed them, and took care of the wounded. Some of them died due to their wounds and we buried them respectfully. But there was something strange with your men. \n\n\u201cAt first I admired their discipline. But after a week we noticed something. Your men had not spoken a word. They did not speak to us which is understandable. But they did not speak to each other. Weeks went by, and then a month. \n\n\u201cSome of your men then tried to escape. I must say, some of their methods were ingenious. While others were quite crude. It is the duty of a prisoner to try and escape captivity but in any case they were all recaptured and disciplined under the rules of the treaty.\u201d\n\nThe captor took a breath. \u201cBut then one month ago something peculiar happened. Your men began talking again. But only in whispers. At first they would whisper to each other. But then they started whispering to the guards.\u201d\n\nDevlin twitched but his face did not betray what he already knew. \n\n\u201cI can only assume you know what happened next. Slowly, the guards began releasing the prisoners. But not only that, they were escaping *with* the prisoners. We did what we could. We changed over the guards, increased discipline, implemented solitary confinement. But one by one they all started to escape. \n\n\u201cWe sent out search parties for them. The ones we did find were dead, guards and prisoners alike. Some we never found, only traces of them. \n\n\u201cIt finally dawned on us what was happening. Sir, you did not cross those mountains to attack us. You were running. Running from something that has killed all of your men and nearly all of mine. Running from something that would cause my soldiers enough fear for them to disobey orders and break free themselves.\u201d \n\nThe captor broke his calm demeanour and leaned forward onto the table. \u201cSir! Colonel Devlin. What is out there?!\u201d\n\nSuddenly there was a thud on the outside of the interrogation room. One of the guards yelled and fired off a string of bullets before a crack was heard and the firing stopped.

Which effectively made John (characteristically) late.\n\nHe tossed his half-smoked cigarette in the gutter, ruminating on his many failed attempts to quit, and the general filth of the city. The bouncer waved him in without checking ID. Beyond the nondescript black door lay the alluring promise of darkness. John fumbled his way up the metal stairs towards the muffled sounds of music and voices. This time, a padded leather door that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a gentlemen\u2019s club from a Hollywood film, separated him from his final destination.\n\nJohn scanned the room as he entered. It was hard enough spotting someone in a crowded room, let alone a dimly lit one, and that broke out into all manner of different sections.

I was younger then,  physically that much is obvious, but I was a younger spirit too. I  didn't know what it felt like to breathe another person's air in, and I  couldn't have known what it was like for someone to spit yours back in  your face. I was only sixteen, and anything was possible, and she was my  ticket to all those possibilities, to a life yet unknown.\n\nCarmen,  my sister had named her, it was only proper that I addressed her by the  same name once she had become mine. I'm the type who doesn't like  changing the name of his pets if they've already been given one, I don't  see why cars should be any different. Hell, I'd hate it if someone  started calling me by something stupid one of these days for no good  reason. But, I guess there's no harm in a nickname - still, she remained  Carmen to me.\n\nIn  my youth I had mistreated her, as most youth do with most things they  don't understand the value in. Tools were tools to me, and relationships  were relationships, and my mother's fascination with dolls and  furniture had pushed me even further away from subjectifying objects. I  drove her too hard, I let my friends blast their shitty music at full  volume through her speakers - I paid quickly for that one, poor Carmen  never sounded the same after that first summer I had her. It didn't take  long for her health to start to fade, she was an older girl, but she  had been properly taken care of before me. Her brakes went out, her oil  turned to slop, and later on, she'd punish me especially harshly by  taking away her cooling capabilities from me - a sentence too cruel to  be served in Texas, regardless of the crime.\n\nI  learned a lot from her though - every time she'd let me know something  was wrong, I learned how to fix it. She taught me to be attentive, to  listen to every bad breath she'd heave, to feel for when her shoes would  start to hurt in the wrong ways. I didn't become a mechanic by any  means, but I was well beyond oil changes and brake swaps by my second  year. By the end of her life, I'd fixed her bumper, given her cleaner  headlamps, replaced the power window assembly on three of her four  doors, you could definitely say we were well acquainted.\n\nThat's  what I think does it to me, now in our twilight together, she's not  just a car to me anymore. I don't think she'd just been a car when I got  her either, but now I know the difference. A car can take you places, a  car has nice features and big cup holders and vents for the rear, but a  car is just a means to an end, no more romantic than a high-tech wagon.  Carmen was something else, Carmen was something to hang out with - I  learned that on one of the many drives between college and my hometown. I  learned it more deeply later on, on the drives I'd make to and from  nowhere: excuses to hang out with Carmen. I remember the wind she cupped  perfectly into my hair as I drove her on, the way she'd hum and purr  beneath my feet so gently. I remember what it felt like when we were in  our prime together.\n\nBut,  Carmen is an older woman - younger than me, but old in her years.  Eventually, the years caught up to her; fixing her became more of a  hassle, and made hanging out with her feel like something tedious. Her  health got worse and worse over the years, and by the time I could start  affording to give her the attention she needed, it was plain to see  that we had outgrown one another.\n\nAs  she sits now, lonely and unattended to for far too long, a fixture in  my garage, I wonder what to do with her. I love her, and I know she  loves me, but the love is different now - love for a long lost past we  shared. So, when I asked her this morning, it didn't surprise me that  she accepted my offer - it almost felt like she had been waiting for  this moment too.\n\nCarmen's  moving on.

How many pieces of silver would she be worth for her flesh alone?\n\nI  don't know what will happen to her if she goes - but I think that's  just life; all I can do is hope.

She was neither tall nor short, thin nor fat. She had long, beautiful, light brown hair, a beautiful face, and a sunny disposition. Her milk teeth had come out and very large ones had replaced them. She was teased by other children, but it never stopped her from smiling.\n\nHome life was happy enough, at that time. Sure, her mother would lash out and beat and her father would get into the ale too much, but the little girl had her brothers, and her very best friend. Her reflection.\n\nThe little girl was fortunate  enough to have a room separate from the rest of the family. She would go there when noise got to be too much for her. She would dream and act, cry and read, and think about what it would be like to have her own cottage with her own little girl.\n\nAh, but the mirror. That was where her best friend lived. You see, other than her teeth, no one had ever made comments about her appearance before, other than to comment on her complexion or eyes. She loved looking at herself, but not in a vain way. The way that birds like to look at themselves. She would watch her mouth form words, learned to wiggle her eyebrows and wink with both eyes, and would use funny voices with different expressions. \n\nWhen the girl would cry, she knew that if she went to her room and shut the door, her best friend would cry with her. They could tell each other that they weren\u2019t at fault and things weren\u2019t always going to be this way. The girl would sniffle and kiss her reflection, and feel better. \n\nThis went on for a long time. And then, one day, the winds shifted. This man that called himself her \u201cREAL Grandpapa\u201d was coming for a visit, and the girl\u2019s mother started acting strangely. The cottage was scrubbed, top to bottom, the beatings came more often and more harsh, and the girl started to go quiet. Not too much at first. Just a little less laughing and smiling. More hair being pushed behind her ears in a soothing gesture. The day for \u201cGrandpapa\u201d to arrive drew closer and closer.\n\nWhen he arrived, the girl was shy. Who was this man that resembled her mother so? Why did his young daughter look like a reflection of her mother? The girl was uneasy, as Grandpapa paid more and more attention to her, giving her a nickname for her smile, and ignoring her mother.\n\nHer Auntie was only five years older than her, how strange. She was mischievous and manipulative, but the girl kept quiet and hoped they\u2019d leave soon. The Auntie was causing trouble with Mother and Grandpapa, acting like a child having a fit whenever he would engage with Mother.\n\nAt long last, Grandpapa and Auntie took their photographs and bid their goodbyes. Auntie promised to write the girl and the girl promised back. As soon as their caravan was out of sight, Mother had tears in her eyes and trembling hands. She went to her bedroom and shut the door.\n\nAfter that, things around the house changed. Bad magic had been stirred up. Mother and Father fought and argued more, each battle worse than the one before. The girl was informed that she was getting fat, had a unibrow, huge crooked teeth, and was too...her. This crushed the girl, and at first, she tried comforting herself the same way she always had.\n\nHer best friend was still there, with her sad smile and tearful eyes. But then the girl REALLY looked at her friend. Mother was right. Her teeth were too big, her eyebrows too bushy and met in the middle, and she did seem a little chubbier than the day before. The girl turned away from her friend and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re hideous. I HATE you.\u201d\n\nAfter that, whenever the girl was reprimanded, picked on, or told she was starting to get \u201cheavy,\u201d she\u2019d sneak up to her room, look at her reflection and give HER the riot act. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be beautiful? Why are you unable to keep from knocking milk over? Why are you so LOUD? Can\u2019t you keep quiet? Can\u2019t you get better grades?\u201d The girl would cry, engulfed in emotion, and turn away from her reflection.\n\nThe years went by, and the girl stopped visiting her friend. She would look into the mirror, only see flaws, and run. She couldn\u2019t stand her reflection, yet looked into a mirror every chance she got. Maybe in a way, she was trying to check in on her old friend, but only sad eyes and a harsh tongue met her.\n\nWhen the girl became a mother, she was so sad and angry all of the time, she lost herself. And one day, when the pain and crying were too much, she started feeling desperate. She needed to do something! Hurt herself, end it all, or make it all better! Her heart pounded hard, she couldn\u2019t hear, breathe or see. She stumbled in front of the mirror and saw her friend. Her friend she had known forever. Her beautiful friend, looking so bereft and terrified.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. I love you, it\u2019s okay.\u201d The girl started muttering and then it got louder. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s okay, we\u2019re OKAY. We\u2019ll be okay. We just need to get through this. I love you. Don\u2019t leave me. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The girl watched her friend slowly calm. They looked at each other in quiet admiration. They had weathered the storm together, just like so many years ago. Things were going to get better, they knew it.\n\nThe girl doesn\u2019t talk to her friend much anymore. Her friend understands, it\u2019s how things have to be. But every once in a while, while the girl is picking at her reflection\u2019s face, tearing her down with sad and angry words, they lock eyes and know that they love each other. \n\nThe End.", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "- The Sneeze Brigade - Chapter 2 - Maggie", "text": " The elevator door opened, emerging was Maggie Strout, young blond woman, with round red glasses.

She stood up and pulled her skirt down as she walked toward the chair.\u00a0\n\n\u201c*Sit please.\u201d* the colonel said. And without taking his eyes from his document he continued ;\u00a0\n\n\u201c*Have you been briefed on Frank and the recovery mission for Entrance 38?\u201d*\n\n*\u201cYes Sir, I am just a bit confused as to why Agent Dallay is still on the mission\u2026 or even in the Brigade, Sir. It seems as he had many reports filed against him.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cThe reports are just because he is a drunk.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cBut Sir, isn\u2019t that an iss-\u201c*\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s not, Agent. This is not your common Military Operation. We, well, we can\u2019t be too picky in choosing our Agents. As you might know.\u201d*\u00a0\n\nThe Colonel took his sight from his document and looked at Maggie. And he added :\u00a0\n\n*\u201cI would have thought that someone in your position would especially know, Agent Strout.\u201d*\n\nShe looked down.\u00a0\n\n\u201c*As I can read from your report, you weren\u2019t even in the military when we found you.\u201d*\u00a0\n\nThe Colonel moved some document that were on his desk, and looked at them.\u00a0\n\n\u201c*I was made aware that you barely passed the physical exam. If it wasn\u2019t for your immense ratio for connectivity, we would have never found you. Or even brought you aboard. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d*\n\n\u201c*That is correct, Colonel.\u201d* replied Maggie as she was still looking down.\u00a0\n\n*\u201cFrank was ALREADY in the Military, in addition to that he was one of the pioneer in developing the Sneeze Program.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cHe went a bit off when he lost his daughter. But we still have use for someone like him. His ratio is even higher than yours. He can connect to well over 90% of Openers.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cI read his file. It is indeed impressive. Definitely one of a kind.\u201d* said Maggie as she now stared at the folder she was holding.\n\n*\u201cYes, Agent, and that is why we need you to make sure we can still count on him.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cFrom his file, Sir, it seems that only Entrance 38 has been a problem in term of mission. But he hasn\u2019t been getting along with most of the Agent he was associated with.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cFrank is a good Agent when it comes to connectivity to an Opener, that is why we NEED him, but he is not the most easy person to be around, and we need to make sure we can still make use of him. That is why you are here, you understand that, right?\u201d*\n\n*\u201cI see from his file that all the agents that were assigned to him asked for a transfer after only a single mission. That is until\u2013\u201c*\n\n*\u201cUntil Agent Clobet, yes. That is quite a tragedy. We had finally an Agent that could control Frank drunkenness\u2019 and put up with him. Tragic indeed.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cThere isn\u2019t much in the file about what happened during Entrance 38.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cFrank has been vague, that is the first mission where Frank lost an Agent.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cWell, physical test after Agent Dallay was back show an extreme high alcohol level, I mean, Sir. It\u2019s pretty obvious that at some point\u2013.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cFrank is always drunk, something else happened with Entrance 38.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cBut, Sir, most likely the level\u2013.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cSomething else, Agent Strout.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d*\n\nMaggie open the folder, and looked at some papers and then said ;\u00a0\n\n*\u201cColonel, it seems there was also a possibility of contamination. But nothing was found.\u201d*\u00a0\n\n*\u201cYes, that is something else we need you to look into.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cThe Opener felt something coming back with Frank, they are rarely wrong. But nothing was found. Did the office was searched?\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIt was, but nothing was found. It does happen that sometimes if only a fraction of the traveler are back \u2013 in this case Agent Clobet didn\u2019t come back \u2013 \u00a0the Opener feels something is off. After the search the scientists down there, thought it was just that.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d*\n\n*\u201cCall it a gut feeling.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cNoted, Sir.\u201d*\n\nThe Colonel started writing again. Then, without looking at her, said ;\u00a0\n\n*\u201cYour job, is to keep an eye on Agent Dallay while you both go back to clean up Entrance 38, and report anything suspicious.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cAside from his drinking problem.\u201d*\n\n*\u201c90% Agent Strout.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cI beg you pardon?\u201d*\n\nThe Colonel stopped writing. Put his pen down, and looked straight at Maggie.\u00a0\n\n*\u201cAgent Strout, 90% is the connectivity compatibility of Frank. Let me be extremely clear, we need him. I don\u2019t care if he is a coke-head, wife-beater, drunken bastard that can barely speak. What we need you to do is just go back to Entrance 38 with Frank, grab the body of our lost Agent while keeping an eye and find out if there was some kind of foul play with Agent Clobet and if Frank somehow managed to bring something over from Entrance 38. Are you up to the task, or should we bring someone else?\u201d*\n\nMaggie stayed silent for a moment. Looking at the Colonel mirror glasses. She took a breath and finally replied ;\u00a0\n\n*\u201cI am, Colonel.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cGreat then, if there is nothing else?\u201d* he replied while showing the door.\u00a0\n\n\u201c*Thank you for your time, Sir.\u201d*\n\nMaggie stood up and started to walk to the door. As she opened it, the Colonel said a last thing ;\u00a0\n\n\u201c*68% isn\u2019t bad, Agent Strout, but it\u2019s not 90%.\u201d*\n\nMaggie nodded and left the room.\u00a0", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88}, {"genre": "Realistic Fiction", "title": "The Insomniac", "text": "I couldn't sleep that night. Tired and frustrated, I got out of bed, took a shower, and dressed for the snowy streets of Boston. Thermals, t-shirt, jeans, and a quirky jacket I'd picked up at the thrift store, that I was quite fond of. I started making plans in my head. I'd take the 5:30am train to Natick after finishing breakfast with a Bloody Mary. There was a diner close to my place that was open through the night. The feeling of frustration was fading, and was quickly being overtaken by a feeling of excitement. I was used to this: I often slept poorly, and had the habit of turning up at work at ungoldly hours.\n\nAs I opened the front door of my building, a gush of cold air blew in. It was 2a, and the streets were empty, covered in a few inches of snow. Perfect timing. I'd probably run into the most random and interesting people. Picking out my first smoke from the pack, I noticed the first human being ambling about. There was no rush to get to the 24-hour diner.\n\nHe looked a bit shabby, but was dressed comfortably for the winter. In his mid-40s, I'd say. Definitely not homeless. A little tipsy, he was drinking a Lagunitas, and was carrying a few more with him. \"Hey there, you wanna trade some smokes for a beer, mate?\", I said as I approached. \"Sure, man. What're you doing up so late?\", he said, handing me a beer. \"I don't get much sleep anyway. Might as well roam about, am I right?\", I said with a smile, as I handed over three Lucky Strikes. \"Bloody hell man. My wife kicked me out, and I'm taking the 7a train to Washington.\" I suspected as much. \"Tough luck, mate. No luggage, eh?\", I said, with a little sympathy. \"No, man. Didn't have enough time to pack. Gonna visit my sis.\" \"I'm heading to South Street to get breakfast. Cherios.\", I said, ending the conversation with a wave.\n\nI was already feeling the rush of being out in the cold on no sleep. I'd make the most of my walk to the diner, I thought to myself, as I plugged into my earphones. Bowie, I figured, as I shuffled through my Spotify. It would be a long and satisfying walk, I thought to myself, as I took another swing of the Lagunitas. I'd have some time to think about breakfast, and the new compiler transform I was developing at work. I spotted few other people, who didn't seem to be interested in picking up conversation. There were few homless people in this part of the world, as the winters were so inhospitable.\n\nAs I approached the diner, I unplugged my earphones, and noticed a bunch of people outside smoking and chatting. I loved South Street, especially at odd hours, because it had such weird mix of people: people working night-shifts, strippers, the unemployed, and people who had trouble sleeping. I took a seat at the bar next to a goth girl, and started scanning the menu for items I'd not tried in the past. The diner was cheap, and the food was decent. And, as was the case with all diners, bottomless coffee. It was always lively, but never noisy. This was probably the only 24-hour diner in Boston, and I lived close to it. I felt so lucky.\n\nWithin thirty seconds of taking a seat at the bar, the waiter had filled my mug with fresh coffee. \"What'll ya have?\", she said, in a completely no-nonsense mannner. \"I'll have the scrambled eggs and bacon, with a side of sausage. And a Bloody Mary to finish off.\" I'd ordered the usual, realizing that I'd tried everything on the menu already. She made a quick note, and concluded with a \"Comin' right up.\" Although I visited this place a lot, I wasn't acquainted with the waiters. They had a lot of customers, and were constantly working. There was nothing special about me. \"Come here often?\", I quipped, turning to the goth girl. She had tatoos all over, and was dressed in black overalls. \"Yeah, it's my jam.\", she said, turning away. She didn't seem to be interested in any further conversation, so I dropped it.\n\nThe bacon was tasty, as were the sausages. The servings were all generous, and I was content with my heavy breakfast. The Bloody Mary had just the right amount of salt and celery, and I took my time to finish. I paid by card, and left without saying another word. I was probably the most square person at South Street, if you were to judge by appearances: I didn't have a single tatoo or piercing, and was employed in a well-paid software company. Every now and then, I'd pick up a short conversation with someone there, but in general, I had little in common with the people there. Yet, I enjoyed their presence.\n\nI was really enjoying the mix of the Mary and nicotine, as I noticed the first rays of light from dawn streaming into the streeets. As I approached the train station, I noticed an aging woman from the distance. My watch read 5a, and I'd packed a book to read on the station and train, but she seemed to be a little distressed. As she approached me, I realized that the winter air must be a little harsh on her. \"Excuse me, but when is the next train?\", she asked, politely. I told her that the first Purple line train wouldn't be for another thirty minutes. \"Aren't you feeling cold?\", I asked her, with concern. \"A little\", she admitted. She must have been downplaying it to be polite. At this point, I showed her how to enter the station and take a seat in a sheletred area. I then proceeded to offer her my coat, to which she shook her head and said, \"It's very kind of you, young man, but I don't want you freezing.\" \"I thought the first train was at 5, but why are you here so early?\", she asked, after a brief pause. I explained that I often didn't get sleep, and this was routine for me. We then proceeded to make plesant conversation about family, friends, and life in Massachusetts.\n\nAt forty past five, we started seeing other passengers. Nearly all of them were going to work. Time passed quickly, and I was soon on the train. After a quick visit to the washroom, I took a seat beside the woman, and started reading Infinite Jest. It was superbly written, and would take me weeks to finish.\n\nI got off at Natick at forty past six, and bid the woman goodbye.

He had done it. He was free. No more late night calls waking him up. No more giant men standing in the corner watching. No more tentacled beasts boring their way into his brain. He didn't realize He was smiling until He ran his 2nd red light. By this point it occurred to him that the cops would probably be looking for him, but He didn't care as soon as He got to the Compound He would be safe.  Just a few more miles and it would all be over. Unless He got caught He thought, and almost as if He Commanded it a flashing blue light  spiraled towards Him. Causing him to floor it. He could see the Compound now sitting right on the horizon. Right in front of him, He just had to outrun the cops. The spedomender crept past a hundred and his bone white knuckles gripped the wheel and  shook from the pressure or maybe the fear. He could see the gate now and the hundreds of guns mounted to them. The cries of what had to be at least eight different cop cars wailed behind him. Their screams were deafening but He ignored them as the wheels of the burnt maroon car crossed the border of the Compound.  \n\nAs soon as the bumper crossed the line a barrage of bullets rained down onto the pursuing police officers. It would have taken a miracle for any of them to survive. No one that the Compound didn't want got in. When He got out and checked the back of the car, He realized that the pile of money He had taken was significantly smaller than when He started his run from the bank. The pile was smaller for sure but at least  half the car was still filled with thousands and thousands of hundred dollar bills. He sighed in relief. His life was his own now. He glanced to the left and all of his joys were crushed when He saw HIM. Ozymanyas. The man that created the Compound. His lithe body rippled with mussels that he never needed to use. The dark velvet of the cape he always wore, swept away the footprints his bare feet left in the soft smooth sand. His crooked smile revealed nothing of the cruel torturous monster he truly was. As he walked closer all sound seem to vanish\n\n   \"This is significantly less than we agree is it not.\" It wasn't a question but a statement. A statement that oozed power. Control.\n\n   \"I-I Know but it-it still a couple  million at least. It-it should be fine.\" He's voice quaked barely above a whisper.\n\n   \"My rules were clear, and my rules were not followed. You know what happens when my rules are broken.\" The harsh timbre of his voice bounced through the compound, leaving a ghastly silence in its wake.\n\n\"Come with me.\" He beckoned for the two mountains of men standing behind him to grab Him. Their bulging muscles wrapped around His body and dragged Him after Ozymanyas, their king. Their god. Windows opened as people lurched out to see their god. All they wanted, no needed was to glimpse the man that would save their lives, The man who offered a promise of eternal life and happiness no matter the cost. \n\nHe knew where they were taking him. He had been there before, the last time he failed to follow orders. The large brick box loomed over the Compound.  The large brick box where the Things were kept. Those horrible horrible Things, that creeped into your mind and stole your most prized memories, your most secret of desires, gone to feed the Things. No  He couldn't go back. No, not again. Not after they stole IT from him. He began to fight back. Kicking, screaming, biting, He had to do whatever in his power to not go back to the large brick building that held the Things. But He couldn't stop it. The much larger men made no reaction to his protests. Before he knew it ,He was back in the large brick building and He could see the Things. Their long twirling bodies curled around each other as they reached for Him. Their mournful cries pierced his ears and all His inhibitions fell away. Their siren song kept him rooted in place He dropped His hands from His ears and sat waiting for the Things to enter Him. Their viscous, gluttonous forms snaked closer and closer, Until the first of them reached His ear. It's mouth clasped around the opening. The serrated teeth of  the Thing pushed deeper into his skull , but he felt nothing his mind was to entranced by Their mournful cries. The Thing's tongue looped it's way down his ear canal landing on His brain. It slipped around smelling for the memories, for whatever would taste the best.  The Thing snuck around His brain His first girlfriend, when He broke His arm, His first boyfriend, when He crashed His dad car. The Thing stopped. Dad. That sounded good. It buried itself deeper into His subconscious until he reached them. Dad. Mom. The flavor was immeasurable. The love, the trauma, the hate , the longing, it was all there. The Thing lapped it's impossibly long tongue around the memories and pulled, and soon He had no memory of Dean and Karla. No memory of his 12 birthday when he was given Rufus. Rufus? Who's Rufus? His fathers smile, his mothers hug gone forever. He felt other memories leave too. His high school graduation someone was proud of him but he just could place who, his marriage he was pretty sure someone was crying tears of joy maybe who was that? The birth of his son. Who was it that beamed in excitement?  Which meant the other Things had also made it into His brain. He collapsed to the ground shuddering, not sure why but knowing it was what he should be doing. Time slowed until it was a crawl. Then he returned. Ozymanya.\n\n\"I think you have learned your Lesson, right?\" Ozymanya looked down at him crumpled in the corner.\n\n\"Come back to the car, Tyler, you are not done yet.\" And with these words Tyler vomited out whatever food he had eaten that day into the small tin bucket in the corner.

I'm not sure where we were, but things changed fast. It started with the silence, the dead calm in the middle of the street. Cars stopped, people looked to the skies, and a second later the world erupted into chaos, a chaos that would never end.\n\nHarley grabbed my hand and we ran, explosions surrounded us as we dodged falling debris, just trying to make sense of what was going on. We kept running until we came across a school that appeared to be untouched, but was surrounded by people, looking scared and confused. We stayed there for a little while, trying to get answers from people, but they were too scared to say much, we just caught snatches of conversation about, \"it was like they came from no where.\" \n\nThe school was packed with people, but we found a corner in a classroom to curl up for the night, it was cold and the floor hard. Neither of us slept well that night. The next morning, we soon found out what \"they\" were. They were monsters, ugly huge greenish monsters, and they were packing some serious weapons. Harley was a corporal in the army so he was soon pushed into being the leader of the group of civilians, and it became a war. \n\nThe evacuation began. We found an army helicopter sitting in the gymnasium, no one knew why it was there but for us it seemed like a miracle, as it was just what we needed. Harley and I led the pack, he knew how to fly so he was going first, but in the rush we got separated from each other, next thing I knew, the helicopter was packed to the rim, and I was left outside. \n\nI told Harley to leave, he had to. There were too many lives at stake, and i Knew he would come back for me.  As I melted back into the crowd, yelling 'I love you' over the sound of the propellers, it occurred to me that I may never see him again.\n\nAnd I didn't.\n\nMonths later. The zone I was in had turned desolate, buildings surrounded by desert. It was a safe zone for humans, but not by much. We had set up temporary beds inside the buildings that lined the street, store fronts mostly. The school where I'd last seen Harley, had been reduced to ash some time ago, by our fighters. I had tried to locate Harley's friends, to see if they had seen or heard from him, but I could not find them. \n\nThe world had changed so much in so little time. The sun was high in the sky, the sand blowing around my feet, I was walking down what used to be a very busy street. It was hot, but I kept the blanket around me to hide from the sun and severe winds. I had heard whispers in the wind, so often thinking it was Harley's voice, that now it was just a cruel comfort, of what I used to have. But even if he was to find me again, he would not recognise me, as I had lost so much weight in these harsh times. I was in a shroud of sadness and isolation.\n\nOn the wind I heard him call my name. My heart didn't skip, I didn't form any hope. It was just another day, the wind being cruel. But it wasn't just another day, because in the distance I could make out a figure, walking toward me.

The crow \u2013 let us call him Ruffleford \u2013 dropped the ribbon onto the concrete pad. \n\n\u201cIs that for me?  Paul asked as he picked up the ribbon.  \u201cI suppose this is a thank you for getting you out of that bind.\u201d \n\nPaul had released the bird from a garden net earlier that day.  The missing right eye being the sole indicator this was the very same crow. \n\nThe Trans Am engine roared once again, sending the blood in Paul\u2019s veins rippling.  \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still in the giving mood, I\u2019d really appreciate if you could figure a way to get that guy to shut the hell up.\u201d \n\nRuffleford took flight. \n\n\u201cI suppose it was a pretty big ask.\u201d \n\nLate that same afternoon, Paul stretched his arms and released a gaping yawn.  He had taken advantage of the silence to take a nap.  Willy and his Trans Am went on an asphalt excursion an hour earlier. \n\nPaul lumbered to his living room window while scraping his scruffy cheeks with fingernails in need of a good clipping.  He had taken a reprieve from shaving - and personal hygiene in general - during the annual summer shutdown of his employer\u2019s factory. \n\nIn place of the Trans Am at Willy\u2019s place was a brown Buick.  A tall man in a speckled brown waist length coat appeared to be consoling Willy\u2019s wife at the door. The consoler departed and made his way up Paul\u2019s sidewalk.  \n\nPaul prematurely opened the door, catching the visitor by surprise in a pre-knock fist formation.\n\n \u201cCan I help you?\u201d Paul inquired of the caller who promptly displayed law enforcement identification. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m Detective Saunders.  I am not sure if you\u2019re aware of this, but your neighbor across the street, Willy Daroch, has been in a fatal car accident.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh my God, that\u2019s awful!\u201d Not a small amount of concern tainted Paul\u2019s surprised reaction.  A tinge of suspicion made him think Ruffleford was tangled up in this somehow. \n\n\u201cAt the risk of sounding insensitive, I understand there was no love lost between you two?\u201d Detective Saunders replied. \n\nPaul twisted his expression into one of feigned ignorance; in the unlikely event Ruffleford was involved. \n\n\u201cThe widow says that over the course of the summer, you have filed at least a half dozen noise complaints against the deceased.\u201d \n\n\u201cA lot of help the police have been with that\u2026\u201d Paul stopped himself short of a verbose rant.  The last thing he needed was to say something that could be interpreted as callous disregard. \n\nThis unspoken cogitation did not go unnoticed by Detective Saunders. \u201cI mean\u2026\u201d Paul continued, but Detective Saunders interjected \u201cI know what you mean, but that\u2019s more of an issue for the bylaw office.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.  Are we through here, or is there something else I can help you with?  I was sort of in the middle of something.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe pillow face speaks for itself.\u201d \n\nPaul\u2019s face went flush, at first with embarrassment, then anger.  \u201cLook, am I suspected of something?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be pretty farfetched to believe someone would go to that much trouble to stage an accident, only to show their hand by desecrating the corpse and steal the car keys, all the while remaining undetected.\u201d \n\nRuffleford\u2019s disembodied shriek caused Paul to shudder. \u201cDesecrated?\u201d \n\n\u201cIf someone was fool enough to leak that little tidbit to the media-sphere we\u2019d deny it.  I just wanted to gauge your reaction when you heard it.\u201d \n\n\u201cDid I pass your test?\u201d Paul asked. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re done here.  Have a good day Mr. Laurence.\u201d    \n\nPaul retreated into his house once Detective Saunders turned the corner in his Buick, then reached into the deepest recesses of his closet and grabbed a handful of clothing.  \n\nHe then staked a pitchfork into the center of his backyard lawn and erected a makeshift scarecrow, using dead leaves as filling. As ridiculous as it may have seemed to him, if Ruffleford was involved in Willy\u2019s death, Paul thought it best to distance himself from the avian. \n\nHe barely put his hand on the patio door handle when Ruffleford cried out behind him.  Paul swung around to find the bird perched comfortably on the pitchfork pinnacle. \n\n\u201cGet the hell out of here!  Don\u2019t you understand you\u2019re not wanted!?\u201d \n\nRuffleford merely inquired with his one unrelenting eye.    \n\n\u201cAlright then, you\u2019ve forced my hand.\u201d \n\nPaul retrieved a .22 rifle from under his bed and assembled a makeshift sniper\u2019s nest at his window facing the backyard.  He poked the barrel out the window, directed into the backyard.  By this time, Ruffleford had departed. \n\nA series of trebly wraps came from the front door.  Paul left his domestic hunters blind and opened the front door to find a set of car keys on the step. \n\nPaul glanced left, then right - on the lookout for brown Buick\u2019s and the like - before picking up the blood-speckled keys. \n\nRuffleford dive-bombed from the rooftop and scratched Paul about the head and face.  The keys hit the ground and Ruffleford promptly ceased his attack, scooped the keys up, and flew over the roof with them firmly in beak. \n\nPaul raced to the backyard and scanned the skies.  He saw Ruffleford hang the keys on a branch high atop a poplar tree in the park behind his house.  In his mind\u2019s eye, he could see his thumb and index fingerprints on the keychain in bas-relief.  If he didn\u2019t know any better he\u2019d have sworn that the crow intended to implicate him as the keys dangled like chimes of culpability. \n\nAn abundance of picnickers and pedestrians dissuaded Paul from embarking on the ascent.  He wiled away the hours and his morale sunk like the setting sun as any hope the keys would fall of their own accord faded with the daylight. \n\nAfter ascertaining the position of the keys one last time as they glimmered in the moonlight, Paul began to climb the poplar.  He navigated from branch to branch until he reached height parity with the keys but they were out of reach.  It was then a simple matter of navigating away from the trunk. \n\n Pussyfooting across the branch as it thinned, Paul inched towards the keys.  Once he was within arm\u2019s reach, he swiped for the keys but Ruffleford emerged from behind a cluster of leaves with outstretched wings, emitting an ear-piercing cry. \n\nPaul lost his footing and reversed his journey in fast forward, cascading downwards until his body finally thudded against a patch of immaculately manicured grass. \n\nThe next morning a bicycle Cop discovered the corpse and spoke into her CB radio.  The right eye of Paul\u2019s corpse had been carved out. \n\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019ve got another one of those \u201caccidents\u201d.\u201d \n\nThe missing eye was aloft, dangling from Ruffleford\u2019s beak.

He pushed buttons hanging in the air, turned augmented dials with precision like a robot as the monitor watched him. They made eye contact as he made one last stroke with his finger in the air. \n\nThe monitor looked at the giant vacuum tube as it started making humming noise.  She was staring at the tube without a blink as she froze. Her eyes become dilated. A tiny dot appeared in the center of the tube where she was concentrating. Then, all of the sudden the tube was filled with dust, gas, and shiny particles with a bang. All that  chaos and mess formed patterns as they moved around. It was like a bunch of fireworks going off in there. After a few seconds, everything merged back to a single dot. The machine wound down, it stopped humming, the monitor\u2019s eyes got back to normal.\n\n\u201cInteresting\u2026\u201d said the monitor as she leaned back. She was catching up her breath. \u201cWe have been running these simulations with hundreds of engineers. None of them came ever close to what you designed\u201d she said curiously. \n\n\u201cWell, we have one task. Tweak the algorithm, use a seed number that would generate the desired result.\u201d said the engineer. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we designed until you, a monitor, tell us what it is,\u201d he added calmly. \n\n\u201cIf you knew I was your monitor, would you have had the same parameters for the simulation?\u201d she asked in an accusing tone. \n\nThe engineer answered the question with another question: \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d \n\n\u201cVery Well\u201d said the monitor. \u201cAs you know the computer picks a handful of candidates. Our job is to look into details of each one. That\u2019s where we come in. We can slow it down in our heads. Rewind, fast forward, pause the events. But you knew that already. \u201d she explained. She then continued: \u201cIn this iteration, the computer highlighted 5 formations. First one was a lush, colorful place. It was like a painting. I frequently switched back there just to look when I got overwhelmed. But there wasn't much going on in terms of the evolution of life.\u201d \n\nAfter a brief pause she went on: \u201cThe second formation was promising. Different forms of life evolved. It was rich and diverse. At its peak, it was swallowed by a dark leak. The third formation had a similar fate.\u201d\n\nThe monitor stood up. \u201cThe fourth one was interesting. Molten ball, water, complete food chain, and an alpha life form just to go extinct to become a resource for the next dominant life form. I presume the artifact that ended the first life form was part of randomness?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d said the engineer. \u201cIn my designs I rely more on the seed and less on the algorithm tweaks. I don\u2019t remember particularly adding events that would create  tandem alpha life forms. It must be random,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cAnd I assume you don\u2019t have the ego or sense of humor to have simulated life forms worshipping you either?\u201d asked the monitor. \u201cThey were literally killing each other for you. Ironically you cannot see or hear them. Either way, it was an undesired outcome, yet somewhat expected. I don\u2019t want to talk about how this formation ended\u201d she said hastily. She then continued:\n\n\u201cI want to talk about the formation five. It was identical to the fourth one. Not just the formation itself but its surroundings as well as associated events. I thought it was a glitch where the computer double-counted the fourth formation for a moment. But I saw that the formation was located all the way on the other end.\u201d Said the monitor. \n\n\u201cSome seeds reported to show repeating patterns,\u201d replied the engineer. \n\nThe monitor continued, \u201cbut their evolution went identical hand in hand. They almost copied each other until the end. Except, one of them outlived the other. As if they were given a very important piece of information.\u201d Said the monitor, again in an accusing tone. \n\nThe engineer never changed his form or face. He simply asked \u201cwhat kind of information would that be?\u201d \n\nThe monitor explained: \u201cthey had the technology to build a computer that can read the current state of their universe and predict the future or guess the past events with 90.9% accuracy. They had used this to their advantage, and adjusted their behaviour along the way until they saw a better predicted future for their survival. They did this until the collapse at the end of the experiment. It is entirely possible that they found a solution for the big collapse as well, but I cannot monitor near and during the collapse so I cannot observe what they learned\u201d\n\nThe engineer started pushing some keys and turning some knobs on his hologram screen as he started talking: \u201cAs you know, we have been living in a shrinking bubble. We are near the end. These experiments aimed at finding a solution to extend the life of our universe. Do you know why we haven\u2019t found one yet?\u201d he asked as he stood up. \u201cBecause our experiments always end early. And you cannot monitor the very end. I always knew that was the case. That is why I used these ancient texts written by Hawking, Einstein, Lee, Devi, that were banned a long time ago just to come up with the seed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had eliminated all the cultists,\u201d said the monitor in disbelief. \u201cI am sorry you wasted your precious time with myths and legends before getting eliminated\u201d\n\n\u201cOur ancestors found the solution, I knew you would be assigned to me after my suspicious *cultist* activities. But I needed a reliable monitor to confirm my theory. This simulation. It is the right one. We found it. As well as the solution. I have been preparing for it.\u201c \n\nThe engineer pushed a big red hologram. The monitor\u2019s eyes get dilated. Everything slowed down in her eyes.

I\u2019d close my eyes if I wasn\u2019t behind a steering wheel. I\u2019d close my eyes forever if the faces didn\u2019t draw themselves there too. It was as if my brain was a projector casting the most nauseatingly, horrifying film on the screen that was the backside of my eyelids. I parked and sat inside my car for a while looking first at the front of my house, then down at my hands focusing only on my fingertips because with just a slight downward motion of the eye I\u2019d be making eye contact with the face my watch formed with its detailing; maybe spiral again at my reflection in the surface of the glass, blending my face into the watch\u2019s.\n\nThat night my wife covered the power outlets. But I knew they were there still, I knew they wanted me to look back at them. I laid in bed on my left side, with my wife to my right behind me. I could hardly look at anything. I could hardly look at the face I\u2019d marvel at each night before bed, I just use the time now to think about when I was still okay with it. I tossed in my sleep and so did she. I laid on my back and stared at the ceiling trying to ignore the millions of faces created by the slightest shadows in the shallow cavities in the wood but I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I beat at my eyes, I beat at my head I couldn't stand it.

He hated how it flickered ever so slightly as the minutes passed, and swore that he could somehow hear a faint tick as 11:01 became 11:02, and 01:09 became 01:10, and so on. Oh, but how he hated the way that green hue illuminated the walls, with the once navy blue paper having faded to blotches of near-white. And Christ, the stains inching down from the ceiling - the grand sum of eight years and the empty promises of a dozen attendants. It was a hot and dry summer night, not that it ever moved a single soul in the entire home to do something about the air-conditioning. Nor were they much inclined to learn more about the growing community of rodents, who certainly had their fair share of the kitchen\u2019s unremarkable and bland grub. How Edward, just two weeks away from 75, managed to linger on this long in these putrid conditions was beyond him.\n\nHe had been, in another lifetime, many things. A carpenter, a soldier, a salesman, a husband, and a widower. Eventful as the years were, Edward did wonder sometimes if his life was no more interesting than that of an average man of his time. Though that was a question he could no longer afford to ponder, for the wheelchair-bound old man was, in his own eyes, a pitiful shadow of some former self. Whether that imagined former self was faithful enough to reality seemed correlated to the strength of the pills he took daily to keep him alive \u2013 not that he could remember what purpose each of the colored tablets served.\n\n\u201cCecilia,\u201d he would sometimes mutter \u2013 a somber invocation of the love he had lost all those years ago. A young woman taken in her prime by that unforgivable ailment, leaving him with only fond memories of those precious seven years together.\n\nThere would be no one to grieve. No one to speak of his qualities and character. No one through whom Edward\u2019s memory could live on. The die had been cast for a mediocre departure, save for the lone bugler, a small honor guard, and a flag-draped casket \u2013 the only mementos proving that he had once lived beyond the lonesome obscurity of his four walls.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ready,\u201d an attendant whispered from the corridor.\n\nThe old man\u2019s attention was drawn to the door, which slowly creaked open to reveal a tall phantomlike figure, wrapped in a hooded indigo robe. Patches of rust covered the scythe\u2019s blade, though they did little to betray the sleek sharpness of the instrument. Little of the reaper\u2019s face could be seen, though as he drew closer, Edward caught sight of a pair of pale lips and a clear-shaved chin.\n\nDeath stood in a silent watch, as if to afford Edward some reflection in his final minutes. But little, if anything, came of it. \n\n\u201cThey never did a thing about those damned stains,\u201d he sighed, as the blade made its rapid descent and brought to an end 74 years, 11 months, and 15 days.\n\n\n\n\u201cRoom 105 ready for turnover?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, just this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow was it?

The money was all in quarters and just enough to pay for his coffee and leave a fifty-cent tip. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was all he had, and he had just decided to trade it for a shitty cup of coffee at a small diner. \n\nOutside, the frigid wind rushed through the narrow city streets, flanked on each side by tall steel buildings. Inside, Marcos sat and sipped hot coffee, staring at the quarters while they were still his. He inspected the date on each one; 1991, 1980, 1985, 1986, 1991 again, 1995, 2006, 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2008. The coins made in the 2000s were stamped with a state, motto, and year they were accepted into the union. Marcos picked up one at random for a closer look.\n\n\u2018Nevada, 1864, The Silver State, 2006, E Pluribus Unum\u2019\n\nThey all had that stupid Latin phrase printed on them. Marcos didn\u2019t know what it meant and frankly, he didn\u2019t care. He took another sip of his coffee, dropped the Nevada quarter, and aimed his dirty fingers for the one dated 1980. \n\nThere was nothing special about this quarter, but like him it was dirty, scratched, had slight pitting, and was the same age as he. Marcos, like this coin, was also released to the world in 1980. \n\nMarcos took another sip of his coffee and began to roll the coin through his fingers. He stared at the back, looking at the eagle perched on arrows. This was some form of symbolism he didn\u2019t care to understand. He rolled the coin back to the front, where Washington\u2019s bust was printed and again focused on the date \u2013 1980. \n\nMarcos, who was not known for his introspective thinking, began to wonder what all that coin had seen in the last 42 years. How many gumball machines, phone booths and picture booths had it run through? How many pockets had this quarter been in? How many cups marked with the words \u2018God bless\u2019, had it been dropped in? Marcos sat there wondering how many states and possibly countries this coin had been to in the last 42 years. \n\nIn 1990, Marcos was 10 years old and had never left his bullshit small town in Northwest PA. He was, however, positive this little quarter had seen most of the United States by that point. \n\nMarcos took another sip of his coffee. It was starting to cool. He hoped the waitress would freshen his cup \u2013 though he doubted it, as he knew he looked homeless. If the caked-up dirt on his fingers and face didn\u2019t give it away, the rotten stench that radiated from him and his tattered clothes certainly did. \n\nMarcos turned his attention back to the coin. 1980. Marcos wondered if this coin had ever brought anybody luck. Had they used it in a slot machine and won any money off it? Had this coin been added with others to purchase a winning lottery ticket? Had this coin been unknowingly dropped, noticed by someone lumbering along who picked it up just before crossing the street; narrowly escaping death from a speeding car? \n\nMarcos sat there staring at the date and took another sip of his now luke-warm coffee. His mind began to drift towards negative scenarios. How many consoles, dirty cup holders, and crumb-infested couches had this coin been forgotten in? How many times had this coin been dropped by someone who didn\u2019t see worth in picking it up? How many phone calls did this coin pay for that were made to break up with someone? How many times was this coin carried by a criminal while in the commission of a crime? Was this coin part of the loot some asshole gained from robbing an innocent? \n\nMarcos sipped his now cold cup of coffee. Outside the wind ran through the urban canyon floor, howling like a lost wolf. He looked at the coin one more time and wondered, how many deaths has this coin been present for?\n\nWith that thought, he moved his eyes from the coin between his fingers to his quickly diminishing cup of coffee. Wanting a refill, he quickly looked around the diner for his waitress. He spotted her talking with a young couple at another table. She clearly had no interest in coming back, not even to drop the check. Marcos downed the last bit of cold coffee and dropped the quarter on the table, landing it with the others. He gathered himself and began the long, shameful walk to the exit. As he opened the door, he was hit with a cold, bee-stinging wind. He shrugged his shoulders up, lowered his head, put one foot in front of the other, and as the door closed behind him, for the first time, asked himself, \n\n\u201cWhere did I go so wrong that a quarter is not only worth more than me but has also lived a more meaningful life?", "ups": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.76}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "Triumph of Esedras", "text": " \u201cBaba?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it Mea?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are demons?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you hear about those?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was in a book I read at school. It said something about how people once believed in demons who would possess people and do bad things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the great news for us is that they\u2019re not real. Humans used to believe in them before we reached the stars.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk Baba,\u201d Mea answered, then paused, \u201cBut what if I think I\u2019ve seen them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019ve you seen them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my dreams!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry Mea.

Human civilization on Esedras had triumphed over the planet many generations ago, and so far their only divergence had been a loss in culinary interest. The original colonists and their descendants only ate food designed to keep themselves sustained.\n\nAerav and Mea walked under the shade of redwoods to school. The rifts of Bacchian, remnants of a moon that collided with southern Esedras long ago, sprinkled the landscape. Close to the school, they met up with coworker and family friends Tria and her daughter Hawa. \n\n\u201cHey Mea, Rav!\u201d Tira exclaimed. \n\n\u201cOh Tria, how\u2019ve you been!\u201d Aerav asked.\n\n\u201cA little stressed, I\u2019m sure you saw-\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.

I\u2019ve heard nothing from any of my early analytics buddies,\u201d Rav asked.\n\n\u201cI asked my federation friend on Proxima if they\u2019ve ever seen neutrino interference, even off the books. Nothing. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. What have your buddies in analytics been saying?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo clue.

It\u2019s either mass equipment failure, or some new phenomenon is presenting itself.

Chemists, physicists, geologists, and everyone in the scientific community had sorted themselves into separate theory camps, each trying to prove their ideas about why this phenomenon was occurring. Brains from Gaia, Proxima, Lorias, Tribus, everywhere, would be arriving in person the next few rotations. An envoy was even sent into Gullan space (a rarity) to see if the Gullan species had ever encountered anything similar.\n\nAerav and Tria had joined the transmission theory\u2019s camp, hypothesizing that the interference must be some sort of transmission from a faraway and extremely intelligent alien species, either a rogue transmission or a message for humanity to decode. Other camps included the Min Jorah \u201cCultists\u201d as Rav would describe them, the false vacuumists, and countless others. \n\n\\-Two rotations later-\n\n\u201cIt has to be some sort of transmission or thing for us to decode. There is no other explanation. False vacuum grows less likely every second, and our data is showing unnatural neutrino movement just above Titon, we just need to decode it,\u201d Tria explained.\n\n\u201cI think we would have figured out how to transmit data with Neutrinos by now if it was possible, Hanson was proven right after Gulla after all. We\u2019re among the first and so far we\u2019re the smartest, I haven\u2019t worked out the math yet but there is precedent to gravitational waves affecting neutrinos,\u201d Cyris retorted.\n\nAerav walked in, \u201cHey guys, just finished calling Mea,\u201d\n\n\u201cHer and Hawa all good?\u201d Tria asked.\n\n\u201cOh yea, I doubt they\u2019ve done anything but play in the trees the past few days,\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would have done the same at their age, if we\u2019re being honest,\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean even if we were down there right now\u2026\u201d\n\nRav turned to Cyris.\n\n\u201cWould you mind, for a moment,\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Cyris replied, leaving the table.\n\n\u201cOur kids have been through so much already.

Our kids are friends, we are really making this work. If we really end up needing to evacuate, I think it could be fun for the kids to possibly move i-\u201d \n\n\u201cI do too.

Suddenly, the artificial gravity of the compound shut off, throwing people around.\n\nAerav was able to grab onto a railing by the window and reached to grab Tria\u2019s hand. He was successful, and pulled her closer to the window. They both watched awestruck as rock just south of them appeared to be glowing from the heat.\n\nSuddenly, the rock exploded. Rav and Tria started moving back from the window slowly, but the low gravity inhibited their reflexive movements, throwing them around.\n\nRav faced Tria, falling slowly, and scooped her up in his arms. \n\nSuddenly, a crash was heard in the levels above them. A piece of rock the size of a large dog landed directly where they were just standing. Another crash, and a larger rock struck a coworker, making him disappear almost instantly.\n\nTornado level wind was rushing through the compound, and separated Rav and Tria. After a moment, Rav finally located her, and attempted to grab her hand.\n\nAnother crash hit the compound.\n\nTria was crushed a few paces in front of Rav. Once a human being full of fear and adrenaline, red mist sprayed in every direction. Rav tried to open his mouth to scream, but no sound came out.\n\nRav backed away slowly, tears floating in front of his iris, mouthing the words, \u201cI love you\u201d over and over.\n\nAnother crash and Aerav himself was gone. \n\nMea and Hawa were in the woods late at night when the explosion appeared in the skies above. The explosion appeared on the western side of the moon, jutting out like a geyser. They began to cry, horrified for their parents.\n\n\\-Two rotations later-\n\nA reunification center had been set up at Mea and Hawa\u2019s school. They waited without much hope. Only one family had been reunified so far. The hours ticked by slower than they ever had.\n\nHours later, a PA announcement called for Mea and Hawa. Overjoyed, they ran to the office, Mea got their first, Hawa not far behind. \n\n\u201cMom!\u201d Hawa screamed.\n\n\u201cHoney, I am so sorry I took so long.\u201d \n\nTria turned her attention to Mia and kneeled down, \u201cMea, I am so sorry,\u201d\n\nMia started sobbing.\n\n\u201cYour father saved my life and a few others.

Regardless, there is a more uncivilised species of goblin found beyond the borders of the States, and to leave out the savagery I have witnessed of them would render my account of the Near Wilds incomplete. So as to not find myself critiqued on the basis of equating the two, I will henceforth be referring to the goblins of the Imperial States as 'civil goblins' and to the goblins I am to write of here as 'wild goblins'.\n\n\\-----\n\nIt is understood throughout the States that the folk of the Near Wilds, whom we call 'Barbarians', are, as a rule, of an unmannered and uncivilised breed; their societies lack history or fine culture, and they have no respect for the dominance of the folk of the States. From my encounters with the wild goblins, I've concluded that they are no exception to this rule. That fact is one that I knew upon first laying my eyes on them: I was east of the Alerine Mountains, travelling north through the desert. Throughout the afternoon, the wind had been growing in strength, both blowing grains of sand in my face, but more pertinently, impeding my progress northward. I had already decided it not be worth attempted to press on any further, so I was instead seeking a place to set camp for the evening, but I was finding that there weren't many good prospects before me. It was then that I heard footsteps from behind. Turning around, I saw it was a strange creature; humanoid, a little less than a metre tall, and with a rather round head. Its skin appeared to be a dirty yellow, but across most of it wrapped strips of white cloth. It had no hair, but did have long side-ward ears which curved around over themselves like those of cattle. As it approached and stood before me I saw across its right cheek a patch of reddish skin like a burn mark. Its right eye was covered in a strip of cloth, but the other looked up at me widely. I saw also half a dozen other figures, as poor in appearance as this one but of varying sizes and amounts of hair, peeking over a nearby sand dune, watching me intently. The one that approached me spoke in an imitation of the common tongue so crude that it made me wince, asking if I needed somewhere to stay the night. It asked so with a quickness and excitement that I was considerably unfond of, but, without many other options at hand, I was forced to oblige the creature. As I communicated this, its eye lit up, and its mouth drew back at the corners in an unseemly grin. I stepped back in horror as the creature, in some outlandish display of brutish emotion, began jumping up and down on the spot like an ape. It companions reacted with similar displays, and some began clapping their hands with each other in the air. The creature near me grabbed my hand tightly, and I recoiled at the gross coarseness of its skin as it led me and the others over to its den.\n\nI would very generously call its den a tent, but in truth, it was little more than a canvas tarpaulin hammered down into a rocky section of the desert, covering a shallow pit about three metres in diameter, but only a metre deep, and without any furnishings to speak of. The goblins lifted a corner of the tarpaulin and followed me as I climbed in. I will say that while it was not particularly comfortable in there \u2014 for it was still dry and sandy, and was much too short for my height \u2014 I will admit it was much cooler, and I was glad to have the tarpaulin shading me from the dry air of the desert. I sat up against the wall, and held my bag tight to my chest, for I feared that if I didn't, one of the curious things might begin prying through it. I looked around at the goblins, who were now sitting down around me, and I asked why it was they were so enthusiastic to bring me to their den, and what it was that they wanted from me. They looked around at each other and paused, before letting out laughs \u2014 laughs! \u2014 you see how these Barbarians have no sense of manner nor respect! One of the goblins spoke to me in the same poor approximation of language, and said that its \"family\" are only curious about me, and that none of them had seen foreigners for a long time. Then, another one of them, I believe it to be female judging by the pitch of its voice, asked me my name. I began to tell it that I was known as Doctor Silverstein, but before I had even finished answering, another younger one asked me my \"job\". I told it that my profession was as an ecologist of the Empyrean Academy. Immediately, another jutted in and asked what the Empyrean Academy was, and, what an ecologist was, and so it went on long into the night. They continued to display neither a sense of etiquette nor a capacity for intellectual conversation, speaking quickly and with gross excitement. You will understand my desire to be free of them as soon possible; it is already normal to feel unsafe around Barbarians, and even more so around such a discourteous kind of them. So, once they had all fell asleep, I surreptitiously climbed out for their den as they slept, and made my way away as fast as I could.\n\nThe various other groups of goblins I encountered in my journey were each different physically, though they were all just as uncouth. In the plateaus of the north Alerine Mountains, I discovered rock goblins with snouts like pigs and large round ears, and they had grown metal-like protrusions from their bare shoulders and backs. They hardly spoke even the common tongue. In the river deltas in the northern ocean I found aquatic goblins who had skin shaded blue and with yellow fins running along it. They had slits for noses and ears, and in the specimens I examined more closely, I even found gills. I attempted not to stay with those aquatic goblins for long, as they were unpleasant and had a natural stench of dead fish to them. And of course, these all differ wildly from the peach-skinned civil goblins of Leona. From all this, I concluded that goblins, much more like animals than people, are subject to evolution, and so each will adapt to the environ they find themselves in, but clearly they are able to do so at a greater rate even than that of other animals, and I suspect that juvenile goblins may be able to physically change even during life. I believe I have made clear the lack of civility and natural barbarity demonstrated by wild goblins enough to justify their inclusion in my documentation of the animals of the Near Wilds, so I will now begin to describe them and their varieties in more detail...\"\n\n*(From my creative writing blog* [The Unseen Servant](https://the-unseen-servant.tumblr.com/)*)*", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Realistic Fiction", "title": "The Night I Return To The Seas", "text": "I walked along the sandy shore as the sun set. The sky lit a dark purple. The wakes drifted into the sand. I sat on the beach, and considered bringing down my boat from my lodge, just by the coast. I gave up sailing five years ago today, and every year, on this day, I take a walk down here. Every year, I consider returning to the seas. Every year, I freak out, and dash home before I even get the chance to sail again.\n\nAnd why did I give up?\n\nFive years ago, I did this exact thing. I walked down the beach, along the sandy shore, and I pulled my boat to the sea. I jumped in, and used my oars to row along the ocean. The night was peaceful. I sailed with no set destination. I kept a map, and I liked to mark out where I had sailed. But this day, I sailed further than usual. The sun set, the sky turned dark, with the starlight reflecting in the clear, blue water. I decided to stop sailing with my oars, and to just go with where ever the ocean takes me. I lay down in my little boat, and zoned out. The waves became white noise. My eyes became heavy.\n\nMy boat streamed into the darkness, and I woke up to alarm bells ringing in my head. The sky had turned black and grey with clouds. The stars had disappeared. The rain pounded against the water. I put up an umbrella. I rotated the boat rapidly, but as I turned, a huge shadow cast over my boat. Somehow, everything became even darker. An eerie feeling erupted in my stomach. A gigantic, Rocky Mountain hung above my head. I hoped I could find my way back home. Trembling, clenching my oars, rapidly and violently smashing them through the crashing waves, terror filled my gut. As if with a mind of its own, or some sort of evil intention, the mountain swung toward me.\n\nHastily, I battled the waves, thudding my oars into the water. I screamed, as I narrowly evaded the falling rocks of the towering peak. The rain hailed off of the unending oceans. I wasted no more time, and blasted through the shrieking rain. The deep vacuums of striking tsunamis snatched my map. I had to make my own way back, with no direction. The huge mountain chased me back.\n\nHours of sailing, and I saw some land in the distance. I began to relax again, and I swore to never coast along the seas again. Once I got to the shore, I found a wooden stick, and I dug it into the ground. Over the weeks, I made a memorial-type tribute in order to remember this day forever - I never wanted to return to the ocean again.\n\nAnd now I sit here, by the dancing flame of a campfire. Reading my diary account of that day, which I had buried in a safe beneath the memorial. I swallow, gulping my bottle of water. I reach into the safe. And with the dim light of the twisting blaze, I look, again, at a new map. I take out a red marker and close the safe again. Leaving the fire behind, I traipse over to a nearby hut. Though it is heavy, I am determined to take this boat out to sea again. Today is the day. The day I return to the oceans. The day which, perhaps, may be my last. But I will not let that stop me. With the barrel of my gun, I row once more into the darkness. A full moon illuminates the sky, mirroring in the clear water.

It was a sound all of us had grown used to these days. From one place to another we marched. The muted browns of our heavy cloaks offset by the soft reds, quiet yellows, and heavy blacks underneath. Most of us rested our tools on our shoulders, me? I held mine at my side where it belonged. Picking up my pace I could hear my brothers voice carry over the wind. He spoke of a new job. One were we would no longer be cold and hungry, and most importantly, out of this twice damned rain. Settling by his side I asked him of just where we were going. Speaking tersely and quickly he told me it was merely a good day of travel away. I could only scoff at that. Merely a day he says. The ground beneath our feet will have turned to mud and water by then. But at last it was still too good of a job to pass up. So I could only grumble softly to myself as we walked. \n\nIt was a cold and dreary night fit only for the most desperate and foolish. Unfortunately I guess that includes me, and this half dead band of misfits. As we settled and made camp for the night I could feel the pit in my gut grow deep. \n\nI hate being right, and I most definitely hate when my advice is not heeded. The soft whispers of steel through air clashed with the hissing and sharp clanging of metal meeting metal. It was a sound I wish I could have forgotten and moved past. Alas fate has deemed me it\u2019s bitch. And so I drew the tool upon my side and waded into the thick of it. Blade singing as blood was freed from its warm prison, coating the dirt and myself as if it was spilled ink. My tool was one well cared for and despite my misgivings my body remembered the motions well. Bodies fell as if grain before a sickle. But I had grow blind to my own shortcomings, arrogant in my prowess. And as I felt pain blossom from beneath my lungs I could only chuckle wetly. A man once told me that those who killed should be prepared to be killed themselves. I had agreed with him that day. Yet as pins and needles spread from my feet and fingers and my breaths grew shallower and sharper I could only think of my regrets, of the what if\u2019s. Of what I could have done better. But as the tears dried upon my face and the rattle of my breath finally faded I could hear a most beautiful sound. One of duality, of the good and bad, of the right and wrong. Of bright stars and a cold abyss. And it felt so right. Like a missing piece of a whole I did not know was incomplete. And so as I died I knew death.

There were zero reasons to stay sane.\n\nNight after night, Mark stayed in his room. No communication nor talking to his friends. It was almost as if he was gone himself. The day came he was forced out of his house. His mother bathe him and clothe him. Mark had such a blank stare on his face. It was as if he was stuck trying not to remember the present.

I forge onwards into the darkness, narrowly evading the branches around me. I reach a clearing and sit down on a toppled tree. I simply exist here as I take in my surroundings.

He scratched over and over again, hearing his nails scrape against his skin. The man sat on the chair trying  with emphatic intent to understand the unworldly things he was hoping to recite back on a piece of paper. The dictionary lay open; a sea of knowledge he could never tap into. Although, that is not what bothered him.  He threw the pen at the sink, the water clogged in it splashing with unbearable intensity. The pen against the metal sink made a clang which sounded like a child reading the alphabet. It was strange. He heard himself say A, then B, then C, then D, then T, then P, then CAT, an animal he thought was so misunderstood for just living how it was born. He empathized with it. He tried to say more words, like FAITH and GOD, like PEN and PAPER. All he could do was say and never write. The letters of the English Alphabet always seemed like a nuisance, having never had the time to learn it himself. How ironic was it that his very own job was to deliver letters to people? Letters written in the language he hated. His neighbors, his children, and everywhere else he went, he was always known as **\"The Postman.\"** \n\nHis title was not a great one, he always thought to himself. It didn't matter until the letters he brought would bring the smiles in people he never knew. The letters he brought would make people thank a person like him, while he stood there frozen with a ghostly smile trying to formulate how you would write those words in paper. It was strange, how he could always tell what words meant but never write them down. What was so different? His frustrations wouldn't allow his mind to think clearly. There was nothing special about being a postman, when the happiness he brought to people was clouded by his own jealousy, his own stupidity and his own worthlessness. How could they love the language so much that it brought smiles to their faces? How could they not see his plight? How dare they love the language he hated, dare smile in front of him, THANK him. That's why the happiness from letters of love and bonds that brought people together was nothing special. In fact, through the years of being a mailman, he had only know pain and slander. It felt like he was entitled to being lower than everyone else.  His friends were the ones who always slandered him most mordantly about his illiteracy. His children thought of him as a disappointing father who could not provide amicable finances. His wife, the only person who loved out of pity, tried to keep their family from crumbling. He held 3 paychecks, all from her different part time jobs, and tore them to pieces. He could read numbers, his face felt hot from the lack of them in there. Pain and Sorrow was as integral to his life as breathing; sometimes it felt like they were the same. He coughed as flaky ashes flew away from a nearby ashtray.\n\nThe mailman hated his job but it also seemed like his job hated him. It haunted him for days on end, ever since he had picked up that ragged uniform that was now torn up on the hanger in a shadowy corner of his home. The uniform was a hand down from the man who had last been \"The Postman.\" He wondered how that man felt about his job, he always had a smile. Well, obviously, he could read. Meanwhile, the current mailman was getting sick of his job. The melancholy of being \"just a postman\" without sufficient means to feed his family tore him up from the inside. He let out a reluctant sigh as the bulb on top of him went out, leaving the room in darkness that crawled its cold fingers around him. The heat had dissipated, his itching had turned to cold shivers that made him want to claw rather than scratch. It was weird, he could not tell what which was worse, the cold or the heat. Maybe if he'd been able to write just one word, things would feel lukewarm. Bearable. He was always used as an example. Not of great things, but of being a burden, a failure being used to incite fear into young children. When he thought of it like that, something felt so sincerely wrong. Mothers would often scoff at him while walking past with their children, twisting their mouth in distaste and teaching their children the value of \"education\" so they could never be like him. It wasn't like he wished the same fate as him on the innocent children, but the sadness that came from these remarks still tore him up from the inside and broke his heart. There was something so inherently wrong with teaching children to fear and disgust the poor and miserable. He always taught his sons to grow up and be better, be at a place where they could help the misguided like himself, not tarnish and berate their misery. Maybe that way of thinking was wrong, maybe it wasn't normal and those as unfortunate as him didn't deserve saving, grace or hope. It was their anathema for being so useless. If it wasn't wrong, then his wife and children would never leave him. Behind him, a car sped past, its headlights rearing its heat into his house through the windows for a fraction of a second. **That second was lukewarm.** \n\nIt had only been two days since his wife had left with the children. He did not recall how he had survived this far. Tears that felt like ice poured down his cheeks as he realized that he was not capable of writing. The letter that sat on the chair was now wet from his tears and blank from his failures. He would not be able to send his last words in a letter to his family. Why had he never learned to read and write? The pen in the sink splashed, taunting him of his failures while repeatedly clanging against the metal sink, singing a chorus of ABC's. Nothing mattered anymore. He wasn't sane it seems because there was no other way to describe the vertigo in his mind. His eyes blurred as he put the rope around his neck and tied it to the ceiling fan. He blinked but no tears poured. He jumped from the chair and struggled against the thread of fiber slowly shredding through the skin at his neck while the weight of his body crushed into itself. Another car sped past his house, its headlights looking into his house like a curious visitor for another fraction of a second. It saw him, body and mind, in absolute silence.

Whether it will ever be read, I cannot say, I can only doubt and pray to the Heavens. Though it is the heavens themselves that seem to have opened up and spread this darkness before us all.\n\nThe clock had struck 12:00, when the first great cracking sound spread through the air, echoing through the streets and alleyways of this town. Perplexion was the first feeling to spread through us all, with people searching in vain for the source of the noise. Perplexion gave way to a growing sense of unease as another crack filled the air, then another, and another. A stench far fowler than any I had encountered before then began to permeate the air. Even the lowliest form of stench covered peasant occasionally had to lean forwards to vomit or hold back the rising bile in their throats and the smell.\n\nAt first I simply dismissed these strange occurrences as perhaps some form of construction work on a new building within the town. It would explain the loud noises, and if sewage was playing a part in its construction, it could also explain the horrific smell.\n\nHowever, any logic or reason was soon cast out of my mind as one final, great crack boomed through the land. And it finally became apparent where the sound had been coming from. Angling my head upwards, I turned upwards, towards the sky as a great black cloud spread across it, blocking out the sun and plunging us all into darkness. Before confusion could even begin to take shape, the ground rumbled beneath our feet, and a bolt of purple lightning seemed to split the very sky itself. \n\nThe clouds began to part, however they did not part to reveal the previously blue sky. A darkness greater than I ever thought possible lay behind those clouds, but that is not what caused the frightened screaming to begin. Reaching down through the clouds was a creature so large and terrible, that any attempt to describe it could not possibly portray the weight its sight placed upon my mind. I wondered if perhaps I had gone mad, much like my sister many years ago who now resides within an Asylum in Cambridge. I would be lying if I said I did not still believe I had undergone some mental break, but I know that what now emerges from the sky, is as real as everything else physical within this world.\n\nA colossal, clawed hand is now reaching towards the town, as if to scoop it up the way a man may scoop up a small section of dirt from the ground, the terrible maw of the creature filled with sharp teeth that almost matched the pale grey colour of its skin, though I could swear on everything I have that the corners of those twisted lips are curved upwards in a smile. What this thing is I cannot say. A test from God? The delusions of a man gone mad as he sits screaming within the walls of an asylum? Or perhaps it is something far beyond our imaginings, far beyond anything we can even begin to comprehend without spiralling into the raving lunacy of someone simply trying to understand our place in this reality.\n\nWhatever the truth, I will not live long enough to discover an answer.

I am literally in a fight for my survival right now. As I brace my lower body for what\u2019s to come, my legs start to tremble, out of exhaustion or out of fear I couldn\u2019t even tell you. I\u2019ve gotten soft. I let out the breath I realized I have been holding for so long. I can feel the blood pumping through my brain, the adrenaline coursing through my veins. Nothing. These moments feel like a lifetime. My shoes are collecting pools of sweat as they squeak against the tiled floor. I\u2019m shirtless in this cold room, but sweating buckets. Beads of sweat are dripping into my eyes, disorienting my vision. Useless fucking eyebrows. Why\u2019d it have to come to this? There are so many things I would have done differently if I knew I\u2019d end up like this. I would\u2019ve done more charity work, been a kinder person. I would\u2019ve called my brother and told him I love him. Maybe God wouldn\u2019t have sent such a difficult test if I had just been better. This whole situation has suddenly made me religious. I clasp my hands together, shaking, begging for a way out. Can I even overcome this? My legs are growing numb as I look upwards into the light. Like the joke that is my life, the lights go out. I have never felt more alone; even God has forsaken me in this cruel world. I wave my arms in defiance to God and the motion sensor lights turn back on. I quickly began another round of heaving and pushing. That was a message from God; I am running out of time. I look down at my watch. 15 minutes have already passed, but this shit is far from over. I grabbed the only tool that was provided to me and realized how dire my situation was. I might not survive. Regardless, I must try. This is what it means to be human. \n\nThe toilet paper was two-fucking-ply. It feels like sandpaper against the unspoken tenth circle of hell that is my asshole. I only do what I must. I wipe and I wipe and I wipe. Still poop. I consider leaving the stall and wobbling over to the sink to wet the problem area, but this is a public restroom. If someone walks in on me, they\u2019d catch a sweaty, naked man wiping his hairy posterior over the sink. Still poop. It\u2019s easier to ask for forgiveness. I bust open the stall, my shirt falling from its hanger and onto the floor. I\u2019ll have to burn it at the stake later. I grab a fist full of water and wipe it against my backside. I\u2019ll have to burn my hand at the stake later too. It has seen enough of this cruel world. I rush back to my stall and continue wiping. Maybe this is why bidets exist. Just as I finish my business, the bathroom door opens. \u201cIs anyone here? Janitor.\u201d I will never forgive myself for what I did next.\n\nI fell silent. The cleaning staff enters and I lift my legs parallel to the floor to avoid detection. \u201cWho the fuck left their shirt in here?\u201d I hear the janitor pick up my shirt as he lets out a sigh in disgust. He leaves the bathroom with my shirt and I quickly stand up, wincing as my numb legs hit the floor. I have to move. Despite my legs screaming abuse, I bolted out of the bathroom and used the emergency exit nearby. As the alarms were blaring and people were filing out of the building, I was already in my car driving back home. \n\n\u201cOh there you are! You missed it!

I continue down the hallway, eyes focused and staring for the treasure I\u2019m looking for.\n\nI walk past a planter pot with a large vibrant green bush growing from it. Small shiny dark blackberries glimmer from just beyond the surface, enticing me to just reach in and grab one. I don\u2019t dare even go near the thing. During the many, ermm, months travelling this endless building, many discoveries have been made. For instance, I do actually need food and water. Though it takes months for a man to even feel the pangs of starvation here and just over one for them to feel the scratch of dehydration, it\u2019s all there nonetheless. And somehow, that makes this whole thing all the eerier.\n\nYou see, in a normal survival situation, say on a deserted island, one would be lucky to survive weeks without food and mere days without water. That is to say despite the sheer urgency of your search, your death would still come fairly quickly. Here though, well, that wasn\u2019t quite the case. You see, in this great labyrinth of a structure, you may starve and dehydrate immensely slowly, but that only meant that sustenance was much harder to come by.\n\nWhilst in a forest or a jungle or a desert, you could at least hope that you\u2019ll turn the next tree or cactus and be met with a buffet of food. Whether that may be fruits or rabbits, here that chance was minuscule. So essentially, every excruciating second spent suffering was only amplified and stretched out until you went insane before you were ever able to die of thirst. And trust me, it\u2019s happened to me on more than one occasion. Do you remember all of those long walks down long corridors and that really long cave? Yeah, that was probably the closest I had ever come to death.\n\nI scamper past the bush of lethally poisoned berries and continue on down the too-bright hallway. My eyes adjust all they can but even still, I\u2019m left to guess most of the objects that come in my way.\n\nAre they deadly or mundane? Will they kill me if I get too close?\n\nI can not tell you how lucky I\u2019ve been in the past with just wondering through rooms all ignorant and unaware that each object could kill me. But you see, I\u2019ve come up with a theory on that one. I think this place has changed a little as I\u2019ve been going through. Perhaps I\u2019ve just entered new areas of the structure where more things are out to kill me or maybe things have changed everywhere for me. If I\u2019m right though, then that would explain why I\u2019ve survived this long.\n\nI continue to walk, my mind wandering with me, always focused on the absence at my side. Despite the dire warnings I\u2019ve given you, what you must know is that I\u2019m pretty much comfortable with traversing this place now.

I stared outside in the driveway for what seemed to be the trillionth time, to see if she had arrived to pick me up. Alas, all that was there was the tar road reflecting off the sunlight permeating through the clouds. I became even more annoyed with Mr. Hayden, my grade school teacher.\n\n\nAfter a long conversation and several attempts to reach Evelyn, he decided it best for me to wait at the bus stop in front of the school, because the security guards were on watch. Here I was. Waiting for Evelyn, whilst the man who was our next door neighbour refused to drop me off. I wonder what type of consciousness you need to abandon a sick boy in pre-school when there was an approaching storm. \n\n\nThat familiar scent came again. I couldn\u2019t quite describe it but as my friends would call it: \u2018raindust\u2019. Inhaling the powder that flew in the air so rich I felt the ecstasy in my soul. All my senses were stimulated and it almost felt like I was transending into a realm unseen to anyone else.\n\n\u00a0\nI could see a brolic, glistening man sitting on a grand bronze throne in a palace of some sorts. He had an abnormally large skull in his right hand with his left hand shining the red-pinkish skull to a consistent off white. He beamed at the fine piece of work he held. After all, when you work so hard at a craft, the results feel better than could ever be imagined. And for Zeus, this was his 5th murder of the day with a dozen hours still on the clock.\u00a0 Today was a lighter day than others, but there was still an unforeseen issue approaching.\n\n\u00a0\nSo when he had polished his most recent skull to the point where he could vaguely identify his face as a reflection, he decided it was time to collect more heads. As soon as he was about to leave, a deafening gong drum sounded. It pierced my ears sharply, but a god of Zeus\u2019 nature remmained unmoved, and was visibly enraged by the resonating drum.\n\u00a0\n\nThe dust was catapult and scattered all across the school as the storm had only begun. Again, the dust was forced into my nostrils by the wild winds. Initially irritated, my discomfort soon turned into an unreal feeling of euphoria. Again, I transcended to a realm never known to man.\n\n\nA clearly obese man sat on a wooden bed with craters covered with cloth. He distinctly had long red hair, a perfectly round pot belly and disproportionate, muscular arms. The hermit himself, that graced all the way from Norway. I may not have recognised him immediately, but the charismatic man I was looking at now was a butcher of gods and creatures alike - the god of thunder and lightning: THOR.\n\n\nHis eyes were highlighted with red gradient and his hair was unkempt. It was difficult to tell... whether the filth accumulated across his body was from his year-long hibernation, or as a result of the abuse he had caused his empty gin drums. Similarly, Thor heard a roaring gong drum. Annoyed, he staggered out of his home and steadied himself on a giant boulder that stood outside his cottage, among the skyscraper-like trees that were all covered with pristine, sparkling snow. Once he composed himself, Thor hopped - at what was an attempted jump - in the air and an ominous silence followed. Suddenly, devastating lightning bolts struck with a booming thunder. He grasped tightly onto a lightning bolt and began swinging towards the noise swiftly. A mimicry of Tarzan.\n\n\nI waited patiently beside the gong. Waiting to see what their true intentions were. Sure enough, the two gods arrived simultaneously, descending from the sky onto the ash bricked floor. The gong stood in front of them both. I watched from the sidelines.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cI promise that today is the day I will end you Thor. No more stalemates!\u201d Zeus pronounced defiantly.\n\n\u201cZeus... I don\u2019t know how many times we have replayed this exact scenario. You think you can defeat me when we are simply equals in our own respect,\u201d Thor fatiguely uttered.\n\n\u201cTrust me. Today above all days. No more stalemates.\u201d Zeus adamantly replied.\n\nThor became more agitated looking at him. \u201cFine. We shall see.\u201d\n\nBeinnnggg... The last bang of the drum went off. There was a brief pause.\n\n\nLooking up to the sky I saw vicious lightning illuminate the night sky. Like a gun shot beside my ear, the thunder began to shake my inner soul. As I squinted my eyes past the absolute downpour of rain, I saw the mountainous figure of Zeus throwing a left hook towards Thor that gloriously caught his jaw and sent him tumbling.\n\n\nA barrage of bolts followed through, peppering Thor with everything he had. But there\u2019s a clear reason why they\u2019re both more than human. In a split second, Thor\u2019s eyes were glowing white and he unleashed a flaming kick that flung Zeus out of view. Thor got back on his feet and now the thunder and lightning were more malicious than ever before. A seat watching the most fantastic lights show ever seen was what it felt like staring at the sky. Zeus was struggling to regain balance, but he had not come this far to play with Thor. A golden thunderbolt appeared in his hand and for a moment, I saw black and white flickers, before he perforated the bolt through Thor\u2019s abdomen. A wild shriek echoed through the stratosphere.\n\n\nThe rain assaulted the Earth and at this point it was impossible for me to visibly notice anything past the gate I stood a couple of metres from. \n\n\nStill, the showdown of all time between gods was abundant entertainment. Thor attempted to find his bearings, before pulling the bolt out of his abdomen. Weak and fatigued, Thor slumped over a cloud. It seemed as if all that could be done was done. The only issue was I momentarily forgot who Thor was: the Norse god of thunder and lightning. A silver object with a wooden handle split through the air making a satisfying swinging sound. It flew out of nowhere into the right hand of Thor, then he reeled back and swung so hard he fell over, as the edge of the metallic object caught Zeus on his left ear. \n\nBIIIIIEEEEENNNNNGGG. \n\nZeus was caught completely off guard and was left daised as he looked aimlessly to the clouds. Thor advanced towards him for the final blow with a gash in his torso, and Zeus went to his last resort, summoning a purple, explosive bolt and raised his arm to bring it crashing down on Thor. As they were about to make catastrophic contact, everything had come to a standstill and all that was left was imminent destruction. \n\n\nBut I knew from the very beginning how it would end. Because there was only one person who came through at all times, without failure. There was only one person who understood the stakes. A radiant white gleam penetrated in between them and with massive fluffy wings and a gorgeous celeste dress, she obliterated both of them within an instant, as she descended from the skies. Evelyn. Through the battering showers she grabbed me from under the shelter and into the pure white sedan, before she sped away. Fear disappeared when Evelyn was around and the familiar feeling of closeness returned.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cJacob... I am so so so sorry.

Sometimes things feel far because you\u2019re above them - it\u2019s all gone right, it\u2019s all beneath you. Nothing can touch you. And sometimes you feel far because you\u2019re drifting away and you don\u2019t know what direction you\u2019re going, and you\u2019re trying to reach back and fix what you\u2019ve done but you\u2019re too far away now and you\u2019ve lost control so you grasp at straws and hope for the impossible but now it\u2019s no use and it\u2019s all over.\nHemanth thought the office would never arrive, but it arrived sooner than he expected.\n\nHe didn\u2019t remember opening the door or checking in, but he ended up in a conference room. He remembered the room clearly: harsh LED light and a hard wooden table, the principal sitting at the other end. And a small plain knife lying daintily, dull from use but sharp enough to hurt.\n\n\u201cDo you know why we called you?\u201d the principal asked after a moment.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d There was no point drawing this out.\n\n\u201cAh. Well.\u201d An awkward pause. The principal was remembering his lines. \u201cWell, let me be the first to tell you: it doesn\u2019t matter. You should still be so proud of your work. You\u2019ve done your best. That\u2019s all that matters! You shouldn\u2019t let this define you! You\u2019re such an incredible student, and we\u2019re so lucky to have you.\u201d\n\nThe words were duller than the knife.\n\n\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s get this over with, shall we? Come over here.\u201d\n\nNow was as good a time as ever.\n\n\u201cPlease - isn\u2019t there extra credit or something? Can I talk to my teacher! She has to have something I can do!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but rules are rules, Hemanth. I\u2019m afraid it has to be done.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound afraid. He sounded bored.\n\nHemanth would\u2019ve run, escaped, but there was no air to breathe. He just stood there as the principal advanced with the knife. With expert precision, he cut the A off Hemanth\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cAgain, I want you to know: it doesn\u2019t matter. Now, have a great break.\u201d\n\n - - -\n\n There was no break. Usually, there wasn\u2019t one anyway. Breaks were for work: taking notes ahead for class, finding summer internships, padding out resumes on LinkedIn. Hemanth did none of these things.\n\n This break was for retreading over every moment not spent slamming his head into a textbook. Every moment of fun he\u2019d been stupid enough to have: hours of TV, music, time with family.\n\nThis break was for obsessing over every single point lost that semester. Every mental error, stupid slip-up, forgotten formula.\n\n This break was for regretting every hour of sleep, every late-night and early-morning cram session. Every cup of tea, every pill of Advil, every headache.\n\n This break was for scrolling aimlessly through the US News rankings. For looking at college forums where perfect people with perfect grades and perfect extracurriculars went to perfect schools. For dirty clothes piling up around his room.\n\nThis break was for hating everyone because they seemed so happy. Hating some because it came so easily to them. Hating others because they expected it to be so easy for him. Hating the school because they pretended it didn\u2019t matter. Hating himself because none of it was enough, because he could never be enough, no matter how hard he tried.\nIt didn\u2019t matter.\n\n- - -\n\nHemanth wasn\u2019t sure if he was happy break ended. If nothing else, it ended the monotony of stewing in his room alone. Sure, there was the initial dread of walking around with his uniform bare and vulnerable. If they hadn\u2019t before, people watched Hemanth now. Here was something new, something unexpected - the high school voyeur\u2019s delight. Of course, nobody said anything directly. But there were plenty of stares and apologetic looks. The eyes of those still wearing letters darted to him with condescending pity or thinly-veiled triumph. Friends disappeared as the hierarchy reshuffled. Hemanth sat alone.\n\nBut nothing anyone did meant anything, really. Nothing they could say or do compared to what he\u2019d already said and done to himself. So he didn\u2019t react or respond. He didn\u2019t do his homework or study. He didn\u2019t do much of anything. It didn\u2019t matter. Nothing really mattered.", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Misc Fiction", "title": "The Alarm Clock that Wouldn't Stop", "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up from a long night\u2019s slumber to the sound of my alarm clock going off next to my 4-post bed. I curled my toes as I stretched happily, overcome with that feeling you get when you know you\u2019ve slept like the dead and are excited to get up and start the day.\n\nWith all the effort and determination I could muster, I broke free from my position of comfort and warmth I had awoken from and reached over to the nightstand and tapped the button I had pressed every morning to turn off the alarm, only this time nothing happened. Believing that I had perhaps pressed the wrong one, my hand fumbled over the clock\u2019s labyrinth of buttons and sliders. I felt the unique lumped shape of the ON/OFF button and reassured myself that my hand was right on top of it. I pressed it again - this time harder, but I was met with no success. I slapped the button a third time, but the steady periodic drone continued to emanate from its thin plastic shell.\n\nI\u2019m one to become easily cranky in the first few moments after waking up. This goes away shortly after getting out of bed, but for those first few moments after opening my eyes, I\u2019d prefer not to be beeped at by a device for any longer than is absolutely necessary to break me free from my slumber.\n\nThe incessant loud noise was beginning to trigger inside me the crankiness that only a two-year-old could match. As more seconds ticked by, I grew more and more annoyed. I then got out of bed and stared into its soulless plastic LED digital display. \u201cI\u2019m up! Shut up!!!\u201d I mashed every button on the (clearly) broken, screaming device as a myriad of bright red LED eyes from the display stared right back at me. Finally, in a fit of desperation, I yanked the cord from the wall. The sound continued, albeit a little bit weaker and slower.\u00a0\n\n*Great*, I thought.\n\nThis particular alarm clock came with a 9v backup battery that I recalled installing when it was new. At the time I thought it was a great idea that would save me from sleeping through important obligations and the unfortunate circumstances that would surely follow should the power go out one night while I was asleep. However on this particular morning, the only reason I could think of to justify such a battery was to make it even more of a pain in the ass to turn the alarm off when the buttons on the top ceased to function.\n\n*It must have been put there by the designers intentionally because they knew all the top buttons would break and they wanted to make it even more annoying to silence.*\n\nChalking this whole conundrum off to some poor designing by a bunch of sadistic alarm clock engineers seeking enjoyment from my inevitable misery, I turned the clock over to reveal the bottom side, only to remember that the battery was secured behind a plastic cover with a screw.\u00a0I let out an agitated growl as I began to grow ever more angry and impatient with this small morning calamity.\n\n*I am not leaving this room until this thing shuts up.*\n\nAfter just cleaning my room the day before, there were no Phillips head screwdrivers in sight. In desperation, I began slapping this plastic screaming box. I slapped from the left and mashed some buttons. I slapped from the right and then mashed some more buttons. Then I slammed my fist down hard from the top. Nothing I did seemed to make the situation any better. The blaring noise continued. Finally, I picked up the monstrosity sitting before me and brought it to eye level.\u00a0\n\n*Something must be done to you. You\u2019re not the first alarm clock that I\u2019ve had to destroy in a fit of morning rage*.\n\nAt this point, I must admit to you that this is not the first time I\u2019ve woken up and encountered a debilitatingly annoying alarm clock situation. The way I usually handle this situation goes as follows:\u00a0\n\nFind nearest hard object with a pointy corner.\u00a0\n\nPick up alarm clock with both hands.\n\nWith the yell of a crazy man, slam the stupid thing down on top of the corner as hard as possible.\n\nThe alarm clock breaks into a bunch of little satisfying pieces.\n\nI walk away from the clock, guts strewn all over the floor, and start my day.\u00a0\n\nI had just moved into a new house, and I was finally beginning to acquire some respectable furniture. There was no way I was going to scratch the paint off of my new desk or dresser by slamming my alarm clock into it. But as I looked around the room hopelessly and grew more and more irritated by the minute, my concern the about the damage this screaming box might do to my furniture was rapidly evaporating.\n\nAha!!\n\nI spotted the location of this alarm clock\u2019s demise. My eyes locked in on a bottom corner of the front right bedpost. I picked the alarm clock up by the cord and with one fell swoop, hurled it into the corner post with all my might.\n\nBAM!!! Pieces scattered all over the floor. I saw the top of the plastic housing land over by the wardrobe. The radio/cd/aux switch and its connector were lying less than a foot away from me. My eyes then landed on the alarm clock\u2019s speaker, which was now lying upside down under the bed.\n\n\u201cHaha! Finally some peace and quiet!\u201d I thought to myself for less than a second. However as I drew in my very next breath, beeping continued ringing with a piercing, rhythmic tone. I then realized to my horror that the stupid thing was still going off.\u00a0\n\n*How can this be!?!* \n\n*The falcon smash method always works!* \n\nI sat down on the floor in front of the remains of the screaming plastic carcass that lay before me. *What do I do now?* I thought to myself. I picked up the remains of the speaker and the radio on/off switch laying next to me, staring at them and their mangled electrical contacts with amazement, horror, and disbelief.\u00a0\n\n*\u2026.This is completely illogical\u2026.*\n\nReality was breaking down.\u00a0\n\nI woke up in my *actual* bed, in my real home, with my phone\u2019s unbelievably loud alarm ringing right next to my ear.

It had taken years to find this place.

All at once the foul goblins and other such creatures tasked with guarding the castle\u2019s slumbering inhabitant leaped out of the shadows, daggers and other crude weaponry clasped in their clawed fingers. Swiftly drawing his blessed blade, he cut all of them down, an ethereal light emanating from the sacred metal. One of the goblins, gravely wounded, held out a trembling hand with jagged claws, croaking out with its last breaths, \u201cPlease, Highness...I beseech you...you cannot--\u201d \n\nThis was met by the creature\u2019s head being removed and being kicked away by the prince. Too long had he been assailed by such obstacles. The time had come to rescue his dearest princess. \n\nAlas, he found that one final trial remained as he ascended the spiral staircase leading into the tower that she was being held in. On the bridge stood the witch whose vile enchantment had kept his love in captivity. \n\n\u201cSo, my prince,\u201d she murmured in a voice that spoke of resignation, as well as a certain amount of determination, \u201cyou have arrived.\u201d \n\n\u201cI come to free my princess from your foul curse, you hag!\u201d he declared as he brandished his weapon. \n\n\u201c I had gathered as much,\u201d she replied sardonically, \u201csince as far as invaders go, you have not exactly been the most stealthy.\u201d \n\n\u201cStand aside, sorceress, or face the righteous vengeance of my blade!\u201d he demanded. She sighed, moving her hands in strange motions, before unleashing a torrent of flame upon him. He raised his shield to defend himself from it, the blaze seeming to press against him as he pushed forward. Through the fire, he saw that the witch was not attempting to do anything different. When he reached her, he struck outward with his weapon, a diagonal cut appearing along her torso. Instantly the crone vanished, and the prince nearly began to sheath his sword before a bolt of lightning struck him in the shoulder. At the other end of the bridge from whence he had come, the witch stood. She had created a decoy. Rage filling him, he rushed at the true witch faster than she could prepare another spell, his eyes flashing. This time, his strike was true, and blood gushed from her wound. Withdrawing it from her, he repeatedly hacked away at her body, then grabbed a torch from the wall and dropped it on her, letting the flames devour her flesh, as was the fate of all witches. At long last, he stood before the door to the tower, which he opened. Inside lay a young woman dressed in splendid garments, cheeks rosy and hair golden, her full lips seeming to plead for him to approach. He did so, and stood at the bedside for a moment before leaning down to kiss her. \n\nInstantly her eyes opened and a smile was shared between them. \n\n\u201cYou have come, my Prince,\u201d she said, voice not even sounding tired. \n\n\u201cYes, my Princess,\u201d he replied. \u201cNow we may complete what we set out to do before that old hag brought you here.\u201d \n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d she crooned, her smile becoming one of malevolence, which the prince matched. \n\nHe said, \u201cNow we may tear this world asunder, and take it for our own, as King and Queen.\u201d Their eyes gleamed all the brighter now.\n\nThey rode off into the night, back to the kingdom she had murdered her father and mother for, her rampage stopped by her grandmother, a woman proficient in the magical arts.

It has always been there. She went to school with it, brushed her teeth with it, and talked with friends with it. A long poll sticking directly out of her gut. Somedays she forgot about it. Other days it was all she could think about. It didn\u2019t matter how she felt about it. There was nothing she wanted to do about it. \n\nOne day Irene and her parents went to Disney Land. The fantastical place was a breeding ground of creativity to most young children. Not Irene. Irene spent her whole time there listening to her parents arguing. They never shut the fuck up. Everyday for Irene was filled with backhanded compliments from her mother to her father. This day was no exception. After years of insistent begging, they finally obliged. \n\nShe rode the roller coaster as her parents argued about the parking. She was alone. Irene talked with her parents to please let off. It didn\u2019t work. The roller coaster took her high into the air and she felt happy. Her father called her mother a gold digger, a term Irene didn\u2019t understand. She noticed near the top her belt wasn\u2019t completely fastened. Her mother told her father after this trip it was over. Irene squirmed awkwardly in her seat just above the peak. Irene asked them to please calm down. The peak was just about to drop. Her father turned to her with wrath. The roller coaster dropped, and Irene felt herself lift from the seat. Her Father lifted his hand with red in his eyes.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that bad,\u201d she would tell others. I honestly forget about it for the most part, which wasn\u2019t untrue.

Places with a lot of people was an immediate no from Irene. \n\n\u201cNo, I like to stay home actually,\u201d she told her friends. Eventually they stopped inviting her to places. Most her friends would say hi to her in passing, but their eyes would linger just a little too long on the pole. Almost all of them gave recommendations to what to do with it. They were all good hearted about it. Irene just didn\u2019t want to go through the pain of removing it; she didn\u2019t even know what to do if it were gone. She had become quite adjusted to not going into the public.\n\nOne day Irene met Charles. He was the nicest person she had ever met. He only talked about the pole when he was certain that Irene wanted to. He made plans with Irene that let them stay away from the public. Everything about Charles sparked a flame in Irene\u2019s heart. The only catch he wanted to live. He wanted to go to the concerts, he wanted to go to the parties, and he loved hanging in a group. Charles invited Irene on a lot of these things and told her it would be fun, but Irene couldn\u2019t stand the idea of the pole being touched. She could see the disappointment in his eyes.\n\nWhen Irene was alone, she would poke and prod the pole to see what she could get away with. Charles decided to go to a concert alone.

I put on my uniform and grabbed my tools and headed out the door. I check my list of names for the day and one stuck out to me. The name said Oliver and in quotations it says, \u201cthe best\u201d. This was highly unusual for my employer, so I decided to stop there first. When I arrived, I investigated the window and saw a young man and his dog sitting in the living room. The man had a concerned look on his face and was talking on the phone. The dog rested his head on the man\u2019s leg and was gently being pet. The dog appeared to be very old with golden fur that faded to white around the eyes. Whenever the man would get up the dog would follow even though it clearly took much effort to do so. As I stared, I could hardly believe it, but I felt something. I pride myself on my ability to carry out my job without guilt or remorse but looking at his dog reminded me of something lost to my past in a life very long ago. I looked down at my list and saw many names and decided I could always come back later for Oliver.\n\nI proceeded with my day as usual trying to keep myself as busy as possible. Any chance my mind got would take me back to that moment, that pain of feeling once more. I made my usual stops at the nursing homes, the hospitals, and several other house calls. As I worked though my list, I started to feel... anxious? What the hell is going on I do not get anxiety. Every name I crossed off took me one step closer to having to go back to Oliver\u2019s home.\n\nFinally, I could procrastinate no more. When I arrived, I saw the young man in the back yard with his dog. They were playing a very slow game of fetch. The ball would not be thrown very far, and the dog gingerly would retrieve it but with a look of joy each time he set it down to be thrown again. The young man looked distraught and exhausted. Every time he picked up the ball, he would take plenty of time to pet the dog and often embrace him. I watched from the shadows with an aching longing that I had thought I would never feel again. He fed the dog an extravagant meal of steak with potatoes, and they spent the rest of the evening sitting on the couch together. The young man had begun to sob, and the dog tried to scoot even closer doing whatever it could to comfort him. They looked each other in the eyes and the man leaned in and kissed the dog on the forehead. The look on the dog\u2019s face was pure happiness. A long life lived watching his boy turn into a man.\n\nEventually the young man got up and gently laid the dogs head on the couch and headed for the restroom. With an ache in my chest, I thought this was as good of a time as any and slowly made my way over to the couch. The dog lifted his head and examined me to see if I was a threat to his human and decided I was not. I took two boney fingers and scratched behind his ears until he was involuntarily smacking the couch with his leg. He looked up to me with his tired old eyes and weakly asked me, \u201cwas I a good boy\u201d?

My wife nearly convinced me that I just had a very vivid imagination as a child.\n\nUntil I found a letter in my post box.\n\nI haven't gotten an actual letter for years, the internet took care of that, postman has been bringing mostly bills and ads. I got really excited when I saw that the letter didn't have any government stamps nor company logos.\n\nI brought the letter inside, set it on a table and started looking for scissors. \"What's that? I didn't know you're so old you still exchange letters with your mates.\" jokingly said my wife, amused at my excitement.\n\n\"I don't, I have no idea who it's from.\" I said and, having found my scissors, I opened the envelope.\n\nThe paper was fine and felt expensive. On it, handwritten with red ink, were these words:\n\n\"Come to the Scarlet mountain. You know the way.\"\n\nI stared in disbelief.\n\nMy wife looked over my shoulder, read the message and started laughing.\n\n\"He's such a dick, he knows how you always obsessed about that place and he does this.\"\n\nI got a little irritated. Of course it was some strange joke by our friend. He's the only other person that was to Scarlet mountain with us. I got my phone out and dialed his number.\n\n\"Long time no hear mate, what's up?\"\n\nThe innocent tone made me even more irritated.\n\n\"I never took you for a prankster. Where did you get red ink?\" I responded angrily.\n\n\"Not sure what you're talking about. You think I pranked you somehow?\"\n\nHe sounded genuinely confused. I decided I was going to give him the benefit of the doubt for now and then beat him up if he was really just pranking me.\n\n\"I got a letter. It mentions Scarlet mountain. No one knows about this except for the three of us.\"\n\nHe got quiet for a while.\n\n\"How about we meet and talk about this?\"\n\nThis was strange. He moved pretty far away and we saw each other only every few years. His following suggestion was even stranger though.\n\n\"We could meet in our hometown, how about that? And while we're there, let's take a walk to the woods, just like when we were kids.\"", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "You\u2019re blind to your own nose.", "text": "\u201cThe poor of this world are easily written off as weak.

She said she had a surprise for me and, covering my eyes with a cloth she found laying around, she led me there. After what genuinely seemed like forever to 7 year old me, she let go of my hand and verbally confirmed we had arrived. I hadn\u2019t seen it, but I heard it and smelled it too. As we ventured beyond the usual meadows and fields, the tractor sounds had grown more and more distant as had the sounds of the village children playing soccer. For a moment, I basked in this previously unknown sensational feeling of anticipation. A chuckle brought me back to earth. Then, my mother spoke, \u201cExciting isn\u2019t it?

She was lying on her bed, head perched on a pillow.

Unsurprising, considering the bed had been there since prior to the War. \n\nShe was motionless, seemingly saving all her strength for speech.

At the crossroads, he offered me a body that doesn\u2019t burn as long as he can roast my soul whenever I decide to dip my toes in the River Styx. When they burned me at the stake they didn\u2019t know I was a real witch whose soul is a thing of fire.\n\nI laughed as the flame tickled my feet and the rope burned away.\n\nThat twilight, when worlds collide, I showed them the color of magic and the taste of their own tongues. With a crow\u2019s caw they were turned to toads and newts. Some bloomed nightshade for hair and none I spared other than those they blame for the ills of the world. I suppose I won\u2019t have to see them again till the man down South comes for what is due.\n\nLydia the Witch lived mostly in peace beside the occasional annihilation of a village, inhabiting shadowed groves and speaking to spirits of the forest. Her brewed potions gave her youth beyond her years and aided her ungodly trips into other planes of being. On Tuesday her body was celestial light, Wednesday wrought of pure liquid imagination. Lydia loved her power, and she loved her life. The only thing that weighed on her was the promise made over a hundred years ago at a crossroads of twilight and dusk. The devil down South wouldn\u2019t hunt her directly Lydia knew, he had the patience of the sea and wind. The years would ware away at her flesh and even with her potions of youth, eventually would crumble to dust like any other mortal. That\u2019s when he\u2019d have me to burn and poke for all eternity. Or maybe he\u2019d just swallow my soul, bite into it like egg yolk and slurp it down in a gulp. No, no, that wouldn\u2019t do. Lydia sat in her wooded grove beneath the boughs of an oak tree and pondered her Faustian dilemma. After a day and night under her thinking tree, she awoke with an epiphany. She could not trick the devil, and so she would have to change the game. Lydia felt very wise. Standing, she began to wander towards the heart of the forest to seek the counsel of the Old Gods. The spirits of Tree, Sky, River, and Stone whispered, spoke, and sang their answer. They could not save her soul from the Devil, but they had heard of a One-eyed wanderer of the North who had hung himself on the Tree of Life. It was said he would help only for a price exacted in ancient knowledge. As it happened, Lydia knew one of the twelve Great Runes so she began her journey into the wild mountains and fjords of the frozen North. Across a bridge of rainbow, her eyes found the city of gold in the clouds. The Tree of Life behind it soared beyond the stars into nebulas, boughs dipping into honey-bunches of gold and purple cosmos. A tall powerfully built warrior who named himself to be Heimdall stopped Lydia on the Bifr\u00f6st bridge but after a few softly spoken words passed between them, she was on her way again to the base of the Tree. Indeed, as the spirits of the forest had said, a noosed one-eyed wanderer swung from the lowest bough of Life. \u201cI know why you have come\u201d spoke the ancient face seemingly old as time. The noose did not impede his speech.\n\n\u201cSplendid! Do you have room up there?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are free to hang out anywhere you\u2019d like - but I warn you, one day this Tree will burn, the seas rise, and the sky will fall with the stars.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, that won\u2019t do. Do you know anywhere I\u2019d be safe from a Devil forever?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the East, there is a Great River. Beseech the Moon in her waters and she may allow you to enter the Land of Reeds if your heart is lighter than a feather.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Hangadr\u00f3ttinn\u201d said Lydia bowing low.\n\nLydia took the sigil of creation in her possession, her most sacred of treasures, and proffered it to the hanged man; a gift fit for a God. She saw a small smile spread across his lips for a moment and then it was gone. A great black-winged raven snatched up the outstretched gift and returned to its perch with the Rune in-claw.\n\n\u201cYou are welcome, noble V\u01eblva.\u201d\n\nAnd so Lydia traveled to the East where the land is a sea of dust and light. Shifting sands and sailing stones were her company as she ventured ever forward unto the birthplace of the sun. Her travels brought a great thirst and soon her throat was as parched as the lands she marched across. When she saw the land abruptly turn green with lush forests and the sounds of birdsong mixed with the rushing waters of life she knew she had come upon the place the hanged man had described. Waterhorses galloped upon the riverbed and taught their young to swim. Rushes and reeds lined either shore and helped to hide the fat-bellied crocodiles who swam idly by. The River ran to the North and Lydia let the waters take her where they would. By the rise of the full Moon Lydia knew how to enter the Land of Reeds. She felt apprehension at the idea of taking the River into her Heart, but then she remembered this hour of darkness was like any other, a fine time to die. And so Lydia the Witch gave the River her last kiss.\n\nThe End", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86}, {"genre": "Realistic Fiction", "title": "Memories", "text": "It hurt. Looking at her hurt.\n\nSam sat at the corner of his favorite bar, in the quiet part of the city that he preferred to the bustle and madness of found in the rest of the city. He watched the amber liquid in his glass slowly swirl in time with his idly spinning hand. It pulled him into unwanted memories that he\u2019d rather just forget. He found himself in an almost dreamlike trance as the memories rushed past him, making him feel as if he was experiencing all of them again.\n\nHe found himself in the very same bar a few years ago. It was like it was frozen in time, nothing having changed over the years. He\u2019d decided to stop by for a drink after a particularly grueling day in the office. That was the very first time he\u2019d ever seen her and despite the many times he\u2019d see her after he\u2019d always remember that evening. It was as if she\u2019d engraved herself directly into his very soul. She sat at the far corner of the bar, slowly nursing her drink. She wasn\u2019t traditionally beautiful per say. However, she was striking, with sharp, intelligent eyes that seemed to drink in everything happening around her at once. Her relaxed confidence as she sat there made her seem much more imposing than her small stature would normally. He knew then that this woman would have an enormous impact on his life. \n\nThe next memory he found himself in was from a year or two after. He was sitting at his table on a warm spring morning, enjoying the feeling of the morning sun peeking through the partially closed blinds. He looked across the table, and he saw her, his beautiful Sarah. She sat there, wearing one of his shirts falling to below her knees, reading something, that judging by the slight smirk on her face, she found quite amusing. Her raven hair falling in a messy tangle about her head and shoulders, as she slowly ate her breakfast and drank her cream and sugar laden pretense of a coffee. Looking at her with the morning rays crossing between them, he felt as if he was seeing her for the first time all over again. It was such a simple a moment, and that made it all the more powerful.\n\nThe final memory that came to him was the very one that he was at the bar trying to drown. He was in the depressingly sterile white hallway, standing in front of the coffee vending machine. He watched it dispense the disgusting excuse for coffee, trying desperately to focus his mind on anything but now. He grabbed the cup and headed back down the hallway, feeling like every step was another weight being tied to his feet. He stopped in front of the small door, wondering how something so unassumingly plain could represent a colossal change in one\u2019s life. He pushed through the door and saw her laying there. She looked even smaller and frailer then she usually did, with none of her usual presence. Standing there, watching a small, tired smile light up her face, he felt her beauty more acutely now than he had ever before. Maybe it was knowing that they wouldn\u2019t have that much longer together, or maybe it was the sheer strength she showed in being able to smile at the worst time of her life, he couldn\u2019t help but feel that she was more beautiful now than ever before. He sat next to her, reaching out to grasp her hand, as the tears slowly rolled down his face. She looked up into his eyes as they quietly held onto that moment in time until that wonderful strength and light faded from her eyes. \n\nIt hurt.

The golden halls stood empty, no singing, no one paying tribute, an utter silence, in the distance thunder rumbled, an ill-boding omen on an ill-boding day. The gods of the mountain had either been exiled, forced to flee or killed. These were dark days, the end days. \n\n\"The darkness has already reached Earth, if it continues it will be the end of us all Apollon. How long before we take action? Zeus is poisoning everything and everyone, how can we...\"\n\n Apollon raised his hand to silence his sister,\n\n \"Artemis, do you think i\u00a0 am blind? He is our father! The king of the gods! Ruler of the sky and everything under it! He is the eagle and the wolf! How could we ever hope to challenge him?\"\n\n They stood at the edge of the mountain and saw violent storms and fires plague the earth, Apollon shed tears. \n\n\"We were supposed to be better than this, better than the ones who ruled before us\".\n\n From their vantage point they helplessly observed a massive tornado laying waste to Athens, Apollon turned to face his sister,\n\n \"Artemis it would mean the end of us all, no more gods, you do understand that do you not?\"\n\n\u00a0 Artemis comforted her brother, \n\n\"It will be the end of the Olympians but it will not be the end of everything, life will endure\". \n\nThey were in agreement, behind them stood the\u00a0 palace of the gods, even though it was drenched it darkness its golden walls was a marvelous sight to behold. They had both seen it countless times but gazing upon it now had an entirely different meaning, they grabbed their bows and began their walk towards an uncertain fate. The mighty golden doors of the palace swung open easily when the pair pushed them, at the end of the massive hall rested a single throne and upon it, the sole inhabitant of the once graceful mount Olympus. \n\n\"Ah, my children, have you come to pay tribute to your father?\" \n\nHis voice was different, distorted, as was he, his body engulfed in darkness and his eyes raged with madness.

Life is ending everywhere, you are choking us all!\"\n\n Zeus laughed,\n\n \"my children this is not an ending but a beginning, i have looked into the dark voids of the heavens and seen what lies beyond! Infinite darkness, cold and beautiful, it is what awaits us all\". \n\nArtemis shook her head, \n\n\"no father, it is what awaits you\",\n\n the god twins drew their bows and aimed them at their father, two arrows were fired in unison, lightning rose from the floor and shattered the arrows before they reached their mark. The room grew cold, the god king slowly rose from his throne, \n\n\"you...you dare challenge me?\" \n\nHe spoke calmly, as if to impart great wisdom or to tell an important story. \n\n\"I will erase you. I shall scorch your names and curse you in a thousand lifetimes! THERE WILL BE NOTHING LEFT OF YOU ONCE MY WILL IS DONE!\" \n\nFrom Zeuses eyes bolts of lightning were shooting out, they engulfed him entirely, he became a lightning storm, the godly pair raised their bows again, thunder rumbled. They never saw him move, lightning flashed from behind Apollon, he turned but to slow, Zeuses punch hit him square in the stomach and created an ear-deafening bang, thunder rumbled impossibly loud again. Artemis saw her brother get launched through the ceiling, she had already leapt back, the time for reasoning was over, she drew her bow and fired three\u00a0 arrows\u00a0 while still being airborne, Zeus dodged the first one, punched the second one to bits and caught the third. \n\n\"Daughter dear, you are going to have to be faster than that\". \n\nArtemis shrugged and pointed to the cracked ceiling, \n\n\"im just buying him some time\".\n\n Through the giant hole in the ceiling Zeus thought he saw a comet but it was much to small. Covered in fire Apollon charged through the cracked ceiling, Zeus threw a lightning bolt, an arrow hailing from Artemis bow managed to change its trajectory, it missed Apollon and with his spear he struck the golden floor, the shock-wave sent Zeus flying. Zeus hit his throne and both throne and king flew until they hit a wall. Zeus got back up again, infuriated by his childrens insolence he growled deep like an animal, his madness knew no limits. The twins joined their hands and Artemis to was engulfed in flames. \n\n\"COME THEN, BOTH AT ONCE!\" \n\nZeus egged them on and they obliged him. They drew their fiery bows and let the arrows fly, they spun and fired again in unison, one after another perfect shots were being fired against Zeus who could do nothing but parry. They\u00a0 moved gracefully and deadly, beautifully they danced the warriors dance across the throne room. As one ducked down to fire low, the other sailed through the air to fire from above, it was nothing short of a\u00a0 perfection. Never had Zeus thought that his children possesed such deadly beauty, lightning and then thunder sang throughout the room, Zeus bounced of the floor to the wall, up to the ceiling and than back to the floor again. The battle was a flurry of colors, lightning and fire dancing around each other menacingly. The two trails of fire split up, Apollon shoulder charged Zeus and sent him flying again, \n\n\"now sister!\" \n\nArtemis summoned her spear of the hunt and threw it with all her might, Zeus saw it coming, just as he was about to catch the spear it froze mid-air, caught by Apollon. Zeus had finally\u00a0 exposed himself, Apollon danced under his extended arm and impaled the King of the gods, bloodlusted Apollon screamed, he drove Zeus backwards and pinned him against the wall. The battle was over, Zeus had been defeated. The god of gods clutched his chest and coughed blood as black as the night, \n\n\"before this is over my children all things will be darkness\".\n\n From his mouth a shadowy sludge emerged, it fell to the floor and died, pinned against the wall was their father, himself again but mortally wounded. \n\n\"My..my children thank you for freeing me from that\u00a0 hellish, dark veil, i wish i could stay but my time is nearing its end.

Squared off in some fenced entrance area the gate to the left hung open. As I proceeded to the left she went right. The low wrought iron fence was damaged. Her fear and panic palpable as she did not turn back towards the exit but squeezing through the gap in the damaged fence. \n\nThe gaps in my memory where of no concern.

Without words the two girls bounded through the door over the back deck down to the street below. \n\nMy mind raced as we ran down the street. Lungs wheezing and breath fading.

There\u2019s a frame behind some of the old ornaments and nicknacks that contains a photo of a bride and groom. \n\n\u2018Wow, is this you?\u2019, I ask as I examine it, \u2018you were quite the looker!\u2019\n\nThe photo is in black and white and is a bit faded but the couple still look as though the could be in a magazine. I pick up another frame. This one shows a woman laughing. She has wavy brown hair falling just above the collar of her lime polka dot dress. Her bright red lipstick and the creases around her eyes make it impossible for me not to smile back at her. \n\nMy smile slips away as I finally get the courage to look at her now. Her crinkly hands draped either side of the big brown armchair. She is wearing a white blouse with a mustard cardigan over the top and a floral skirt that reaches just below her knees. Out the top of her slip on tan shoes and frilly white socks, her thin blue legs glare at me. She looks cold. Her glasses are attached to a chain around her neck but they have slipped down her face. There is a headscarf wrapped around her wispy grey hair so I cannot tell how long it is. Her face seems somehow sad and lonely, despite not showing any true emotion. \n\n\u2018I see you still like the red! It\u2019s suits you\u2019, I say as I stare at her cracked lipstick on her open mouth. \n\nI see something moving next to her.

The moon a pale light behind the clouds. The wind was like music through the trees, but it wasn\u2019t a comfort. It sang of death and horrors unimaginable. The smell of burning flesh and curdled blood assaulted their noses still, though the town was miles behind them. They had not stopped running. For hours they fled until their knees buckled and their feet bruised. It seemed like an eternity since they left. Only now had they stopped, though they were not still. Shaking, they huddled around the small fire that Ivan had managed to build. The cave they settled in was damp and cold, but it was a respite from the terrors outside. Bronn reached into his bag and pulled out a small loaf of bread. Old and stale but they were glad to fill their bellies with something. He tore it into four parts and passed them to the others.  \n\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d asked Eliza, putting her hand on her husband\u2019s arm.

She and the others ate the food savagely, like it had been a lifetime since they had tasted bread. Still, they were not full, but it would have to do. Bronn inched closer to Eliza, wrapping his arm around her. He motioned for two young boys to come over and together they warmed themselves by the fire. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared papa\u201d whispered Elias, the youngest of the two.\n\n\u201cI know son, but we need to be brave now.

Once we\u2019re there, we\u2019ll be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Elias\u201d said Ewan, \u201cFather always protects us.\u201d\n\nBronn smiled and put his hand on Ewan\u2019s shoulder, giving him a gentle, comforting squeeze. \n\n\u201cYou boys should rest now. We all should\u201d\n\nEliza laid down, bundling a small blanket beneath her head and pulling her children in close. Exhaustion overtook them and within moments they were fast asleep. It was quiet now, save for the sparks of the fire and sound of grumbled whispers. Bronn looked over to Ivan who was madly flipping though the pages of a book.\n\n\u201cYou should sleep too old man.\u201d Ivan kept flipping through his books, paying no mind to Bronn. It was as if he was in a trance. \n\n\u201cIvan!\u201d Bronn said again louder, trying not to wake the others. Ivan jolted up, like he was awoken from a nightmare.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry Bronn. I just can\u2019t figure it out. There hasn\u2019t been something like in these parts for decades. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.

Their screams.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither can I\u201d Bronn said as he put more branches on the fire. \u201cBut we need to get some rest now or we may very well join them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right\u201d said Ivan, leaning back against the stone wall. \u201cThank you, Bronn. For saving me.\u201d\n\nBronn grunted in acknowledgment and laid down by Eliza. Before long, dreams had taken him.\n\nBronn was back at his forge. The fire of the hearth warming his skin. He could hear the sounds of laughter and games being played. Walking over to the house, he saw Eliza preparing dinner. The smell of the stew was enough to make his mouth water. He approached Eliza and put his arms around her waist, kissing her neck.\n\n\u201cHello my love. It smells delicious in here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll done for the day?\u201d she asked playfully, turning to kiss him. \u201cGo fetch the kids would you, dinner will be ready soon.\u201d\n\nBronn walked over to the door and called for Elias and Ewan, but there was no answer. He called again before noticing that everything had gone silent. The cheerful laughter had been replaced by an eerie nothingness. Suddenly, everything grew dark, and a sour smell overtook his nose. He could feel an immense pressure, like something was squeezing him. Quickly he turned to find Eliza but was greeted by a black, endless void. He tried to yell, call out to someone, but his voice fell silent. Then he noticed something. A figure. It appeared to be far away from him and yet, too close. He could barely make it out from the shadows around it, but he could tell something wasn\u2019t right. It looked almost human, but not. Bronn could feel the fear swelling within him. Every instinct was telling him to run but he was frozen. It started moving. A gaunt, sickly walk. As it moved closer, he could hear something. The sound of words unknown to him. Evil and hissing through an unnatural mouth, each word tormented him. Just as the creature was upon him it let out a single sound. Shrill, ghostly it shrieked,\n\n\u201cBRONN!\u201d\n\nHe awoke in a panic. His clothes were wet with sweat and palms bled from clenching his fists. The morning sun was breaking into the cave, and he breathed a sigh of relief. It was only a dream. Bronn reached over to hold Eliza, but his hand found nothing. He sat up, looking for his family but they were gone. He heard a cry come from outside. It was Ivan.\n\n\u2018\u2019Bronn, come quick!\u201d\n\nBronn ran for the light, his heart racing, dreading what he might find. When he reached the cave entrance, he saw Ivan. On his knees, clutching his face in his hands. Bronn looked to the trees and what he saw stopped him on the spot. His knees began to tremble, and his eyes welled. Blood stained the trees and the ground below. Ravens happily sat perched on the branching, cheering for their new feast. Stuck to the trees, nails in their hands, was Bronn\u2019s family. Their flesh flayed, torn away and their bowels left to hang with them. Below them lay their heads, piled in an almost neat fashion. A note rested among them. Bronn stepped forward, a grim look on his face as he grabbed the note.

These were all whispered amongst the citizens as they kept as far away from the gate as possible.\u00a0\n\nEventually, Lom found himself planning in the bunker under the police station. It was really a  basement, but the times had necessitated a safer name for their dreary dwelling.

It had been that day at Mama Lily's Cajun Cafe in Sector 12. Faith was meeting Nick for lunch. It had been a while since their schedules had allowed them an impromptu meal at one of their favorite haunts. She was hoping it would help put her mind at ease. The two were going to discuss his upcoming trip to Mars.\n\nFaith strode up the corridor, hands in her lab coat. Her shoulder length, auburn hair flowed gracefully in the one-sixth gravity. She had decided to walk from the lab instead of taking a tube-car. She wanted to stretch her legs.\n\nThe path began to widen like a river delta, spilling into the food court. She spotted a few familiar faces sitting at other eateries. The latest expansion had done wonders for the variety of culinary options available to base residents. Even before reaching the entrance, she could identify the rich aromas coming from the cafe. Holding her eyes closed for an extra beat, she inhaled deeply. She smiled as the smell of Louisiana cooking washed over her.\n\nAs she turned the corner into the cafe dining area, Faith saw her. She was walking towards the entrance. Red blouse, black skirt, white lab coat brunette hair. Same color scheme every time Faith saw her. She was coming from the direction of the table where Nick was sitting. *Their* table.\n\n\"Oh you can't be serious,\" Faith thought as she saw the woman approach. It took all her fortitude not to break stride as the woman drew near. The woman on the other hand seemed to walk with an air of defiance. As they passed each other, Faith saw the woman watching her from the corner of her eye. And unbelievably, on her lips, a grin?\n\n\"Jesus\" she hissed under her breath.\n\nFaith's demeanor swiftly moved from indignation to rage. Against the odds, she held her outward composure. She focused her eyes on her husband, smiling brightly as he stood to greet her. She would not give Nick and the woman the satisfaction of having a public meltdown. But she knew she would not let them hurt her like this again.\n\nAs they ate, Faith and Nick discussed his travel itinerary. He was leaving in four days. He still had some items to take care of at his office. He still needed to inspect and pack his vac suit plus a few other things. On the outside, Faith was pleasant and calm. She even reached out to hold his hand at one point. But inside, she seethed.\n\n\"I bet he was making plans with that whore,\" she thought to herself. \"That's why she was here.\" She was glad she had arrived a few minutes early to see them. It was then she knew she had to follow through with her plans. There was no going back. Any trepidation she had felt earlier had evaporated under the heat of an anger-fueled sun.

Jackalope Rhymes was on a table with a hole in his chest; the brothers Dinklage lying down next to each other; \u201cBeat All\u201d Jusso was on the floor with a puddle of blood forming next to his head.\n\n\nThe shelf behind the counter had bottles mostly shattered, with one lucky whiskey bottle untouched. At the counter, only one man, smoking and staring at the destroyed drinks in front of him.\n\n\nCurly hair, blue jacket with a folded collar, black jeans, boots with spurs. He could be any cowboy, but one detail gave him away: a scar of ripped flesh around his neck, the memento to his miraculous escape from death.\n\n\nRedstring.\n\n\nHe turned around and...\n\n\n*Click*\n\n\nFreezed.\n\n\n\u201cNow, now, what do we have here?\u201d\n\n\nRedstring had his aim on him. He turned around and stepped closer, as running away would be fatal. Redstring pointed with his pistol to the seat at his front. He pushed the chair. The cowboy blew a stream of smoke on him.\n\n\n\u201cWhat's your name, pal?\u201d\n\n\nThe cowboy sounded nonchalant, brandishing a smile with no traces of guilt.\n\n\n\u201cI'm...\u201d he stuttered. \u201cI'm Hampshire. Robert Hampshire. I'm- I'm but a traveler, see?\u201d\n\n\nThe cowboy raised his eyebrow.\n\n\n\u201cMy curiosity,\u201d Hampshire continued. \u201cMade me come into here after all those shots. I didn't come for your bounty, Redstring. Y- Your reputation precedes, you know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou didn't?\u201d Redstring asked. He grabbed a cigar from a pack in his pocket and lit it up with a silver lighter. \u201cThen you're losing your golden chance.\u201d\n\n\nThe cowboy blew another stream. Hampshire coughed.\n\n\n\u201cSay, I'm bored. Why don't we play a game?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. A poker game. You're in?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, no, I can't. It's against my religion; we can't gamble.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThe cowboy blew another stream.\n\n\n\u201cWhat about a riddle game, then?\u201d\n\n\nHampshire frowned.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\n\n\n\u201cA riddle game. I'll make three riddles and you have to answer them all correctly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf I don't?\u201d\n\n\n*Bang.*\n\n\nHampshire flinched as the untouched bottle of whiskey shattered into fragments. He laid his eyes back on Redstring and he was still staring. The cowboy didn't have to look.\u00a0\n\n\nHampshire swallowed dry.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCan we start?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes\u2026 Surely.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nRedstring threw the cigar's stub across the saloon. It fell into the mouth of old Don Jane's corpse, who died attempting to scream. He would have done it if the bullet hadn't gone through his vocal chords.\n\n\n\u201cFirst riddle: \u2018I stroll the desert day and night in an incessant journey. The wind is my guide and only it I follow. Despite this, I have no legs. What am I?\u2019\u201d\n\n\nHampshire thought, staring down at the counter's woodwork so he didn't face the killer's smile or his dead bunch. The answer came to him and left his mind over a stuttering voice and lips that begged for mercy.\n\n\n\u201cA- A- A tumbleweed?\u201d he shut his eyes.\n\n\n*Click.*\n\n\nHampshire slowly opened them back. Redstring had pulled back the pistol's hammer. The cowboy nodded.\n\n\n\u201cSharp mind you got there, pal!\u201d\n\n\nHe sighed in relief,\u00a0 letting out a smirk form on the corner of his mouth.\n\n\n*Click.*\n\n\nThe smirk died and he froze. He noticed a loss of intensity in Redstring's smile, as if his muscles were not able to hold it that way for any longer.\n\n\n\u201cNext riddle: \u201cI'm everywhere. I'm tomorrow, I'm yesterday, I'm present. I'm at the highest of the mountains and the deepest of the oceans. I'm at your back and at your front too, but you never seem to notice. What am I?\u201d\n\n\nSweat dripped from his forehead. His first thought was \u201cGod\u201d, who he knew as Jehovah, but did that cold blooded man even believed in God? He should. What other force could have saved him from the gallows if not the Lord's invisible hand? Then he thought about the gallows.\n\n\n\u201cDeath,\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer is death.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\n*Click.*\n\n\nThe cowboy put his gun back in the holster.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's it. That was his chance. He got up from the seat.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell, I believe-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. I said three riddles, didn't I ?\u201d\n\n\nHampshire could have just pulled his gun and ended that, but if there was one thing he told the gunslinger that wasn't a lie, it would be his deadly curiosity.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes, of course. Say it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI'm a lying bastard who'd been following Redstring with his bunch like a *pack of filthy coyotes waiting for a moment* **he was slightly distracted so we could pull out our guns on him** ***WHILE I STAYED OUTSIDE AND LET MY MINIONS DO THE WORK FOR ME AS I'M NOTHING THAN A***\n\n#DEAD COWARD!\n\n\n*Bang.*\n\n\n*Bang.*\n\n\n*Bang.*\n\n\nWolfgang Mutty, or as he claimed, \u201cHampshire\u201d, crawled on the floor with one bullet in his liver, one on his guts and one in the bladder. He groaned in despair while blood puked out of his mouth. He reached the swinging doors, until he felt the pressure of a boot pinning him down.\n\n\n\u201cI could let you go,\u201d the voice of the reaper said. \u201cBut simply saying for you to get rid of this life of jeopardy wouldn't make you change a thing, would it?

Their latest fun activity was to race their bicycles as fast as they could down to the ice-cream truck in the park. Sadly Sarah couldn\u2019t participate. She still used training wheels, you see. Her friends could go so much faster and didn\u2019t have to stick to the paths so when Sarah caught up they had already got their ice-creams and she was always left behind trying to get one. Soon enough Sarah got fed up and begged her parents to teach her to ride but they were always too busy. She felt so lonely every time her friends rode off on their bicycles. She wanted to do that as well.\n \nSuddenly, Sarah had an idea. She grabbed her bike and dragged it into their garage and snuck into her father\u2019s toolbox. She didn\u2019t know what she was looking for and the pile of tools was like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but she was determined. She spent her afternoon picking up tools and trying them on the bolts of her bike. Eventually, after several hours she found what she needed and got to work removing the training wheels. The bolts were on so tight she would\u2019ve thought they were tightened by the Hulk himself. But after much pushing and pulling they came loose and a sigh of relief escaped Sarah\u2019s mouth. The extra wheels were discarded on the floor as if they were broken toys. Sarah ran back into her house and yelled to her mother, who was busy typing on the computer, that she was going out with her friends. Her mother only grunted back a sound of acceptance and didn\u2019t even turn to look at her daughter. Sarah grinned a mischievous grin and ran back to the garage, picked up her newly renovated bike and pushed it out onto the street.\n \nAfter a tiring walk to the dilapidated car park next to the park she paused. Her nerves were wrought but her determination prevailed as she pushed through it and got on her bike. She almost immediately fell over and bruised her arm. This was going to be much harder than she thought. Try after try, fall after fall, bruise after bruise, she almost gave up but eventually she managed to cycle a few metres. It wasn\u2019t much but it was a step in the right direction for Sarah. So she hopped on her bicycle and tried again. This time she went a few more metres. The next go a few more. Until she was cycling anti-clockwise around the car park. This was a massive achievement for her and she was so proud of herself, but it wasn\u2019t the end to her struggles. Next she had to tackle right hand turns.\n \n\u201cThis will be a cakewalk,\u201d Sarah said to herself. However this was no ride in the park. As soon as she attempted to turn right she fell off and grazed her knee. She sat up as blood trickled from the wound, she wanted to cry but she knew there was no one there to comfort her and she didn\u2019t want to be stopped so soon. Sarah stood up, picked up her bicycle, and jumped back on once again. A little bit of blood wasn\u2019t going to stop her. \n \nSarah peddled and peddled, trying a right turn again and again, her knee was stinging but her stubbornness to finish and motivation to learn kept her going. Soon enough, after many wobbles and falls, she finally got it. She was overjoyed! She could finally ride her bike with her friends. She felt like she had climbed Mount Everest. Nothing in the world could bring her down. She couldn\u2019t wait to show her friends when they went to the park on Saturday.\n \nAs the week came and went, it was agonisingly long for Sarah. She was so excited and almost told her friends multiple times, but she wanted to surprise them so much she managed to keep it a secret. Soon enough it was Saturday. She woke up early in the morning and got ready. They were supposed to meet at ten but she got there at nine so she could make sure she hadn\u2019t lost her groove. After an hour of tentative waiting and looking at her watch as if it was going to jump off her wrist and run away, her friends arrived. They all rode up on their bikes and Sarah was there to meet them. It was quite a surprise for them as a week before there were pink little training wheels on Sarah\u2019s bike and now there were none. She excitedly challenged them to race down to the ice-cream truck, and though surprised, agreed. As they raced down together as a group Sarah no longer felt alone and was happy to be able to race and play with her friends again.", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Fantasy", "title": "A Different Kind of Dragon", "text": "Sir Davin \u201cThe Freeblade\u201d was the greatest knight of the realms. He put it upon himself to travel the land, smiting evil and protecting the innocent, with no care for borders or politics. If someone needed help, he would give it. His gilded armor and greatsword became a symbol of peace and prosperity across the kingdoms.\n\nRecently Davin learned of an isolated city that was brought to ruin by a dragon, and the survivors were forced to serve the beast and give up their valuables to it. He rode south, towards the ruins formerly known as Kanithar.\n\nHe could see the ruined castle from a mile away. Partially collapsed and with signs of fire damage, the calling card of a dragon. While offering coin and food to the poor peasants, Davin learned that the dragon slayed the former Queen and took control of a nearby mountain, taking over the tribes of goblins, ogres, and lizardmen that lived in the area. Davin knew what to do.\n\nA few days of travel lead the knight to a cave near the top of the mountain. He noticed monsters watching him as he traveled, but never attacking. \u201cAn ambush?\u201d He thought. \u201cA trap? Do they fear the legendary Freeblade, or maybe they hope I kill the dragon.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t his first dragon. This cave was definitely a dragon\u2019s lair, but it lacked traps, or minions guarding it. \u201cDoes this dragon not think they need protection?\u201d Davin questioned. \u201cThis beast must be powerful, or foolish.\u201d\n\nA slow, cautious, walk through the dark cave led Davin into a torched lit cavern. This cavern was filled with piles upon piles of treasure. Gold, gems, weapons and armor, artwork, everything the vain beast would keep in a horde. But the beast was missing.\n\nDavin walked through the field of treasures, sword ready, looking for the sleeping lizard. He tried to be as quiet as possible, but each step landed on some loose coinage. It was long for him to come face to face with the horror.\n\nA red-scaled claw reached out of a pile of coins. It was smaller than what Davin was used to, but definitely draconic. He could see two piercing, glowing, yellow eyes under the jewels. \u201cWho dares disturb me?\u201d The deep, yet feminine voice said.\n\nDavin pointed his sword towards the voice. \u201cI am Sir Davin, the Freeblade. A knight who protects the weak against the evils who seek to enslave or kill them. I will slay you beast, and save the people of Kanithar.\u201d\n\nThe dragon laughed. \u201cSave them? They\u2019re fine!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou destroyed their city and killed their rulers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Kanithar royal family were tyrants. Civil war was bound to happen, I merely offered my hand in assistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what about the stolen treasure?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only gold I\u2019ve taken from Kanithar was payment for helping the rebels. The rest belonged to my father, who was killed by a knight like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe knight\u2019s kill monsters, it\u2019s our sworn duty!\u201d\n\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MONSTERS!\u201d She snapped with a plume fire that Davin barely dodged. \u201cMy father harmed no man, but knights still hunted him down and slaughtered him. I refuse for something like that to happen again. All of Kanithar is under my protection, I suggest you leave.\u201d\n\nDavin stabbed his sword into the pile of treasure, hoping to hit the dragon\u2019s face. She avoided the blade by sinking into the pile, before exploding out onto Davin.\n\nThe dragon was only slightly taller than him, with long red hair and scales only on her arms and legs. She wasn\u2019t a dragon, but only half-dragon.\n\nDavin\u2019s arms were pinned to the ground and his sword was thrown into the horde. His helmet\u2019s visor was covered by the loose fitting gown she was wearing, but he was able to make out the insignia of the Kanithar royal family.\n\n\u201cYou break into my home, insult my father, and try to KILL ME!\u201d The half-dragon screeched. \u201cNoble knight my ass! I will hang you by your own intestines!\u201d\n\nDavin felt himself being lifted into the air. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019M SORRY!\u201d He never felt so much fear in his life.\n\nThe dragon dropped him, but he was hurt by the fall. \u201cNow leave.\u201d She said flying over the man.\n\nFinally getting a good view, the knight found the dragon terrifyingly beautiful. \u201cLet me repay you for my transgressions.\u201d\n\nDavin, the Freeblade, a knight who wandered the land, was never seen again.

He lived in a shack in the forest without much to do. He only had one important task, and that was to bring fresh flowers to his wife\u2019s and daughter\u2019s graves every week. This week was special though, because it was his daughter\u2019s 16th birthday in two days. It also coincidentally happened to be the same day as the 5th anniversary of her death. \n\nThere was one issue this week though. Ever since the earth started to freeze, flowers became more rare, and in turn, expensive. The government stated on the news a few days ago that there were no more flowers on the earth. Not even a single petal or seed. They had all died out from the numbing cold, so Rutger came to a single conclusion: he would search for a bouquet of flowers himself. He did not believe that there wasn\u2019t a single flower on the earth. There had to be a few that somehow survived. He clinged onto this pitiful hope, and put on his ragged coat. \n\nHe set off for Shitsubou Mountain, a mountain he has gone to many times in the past to hunt. He remembered seeing many beautiful flowers there. He also remembered the way his daughter\u2019s amber eyes would gleam with delight whenever he brought a bouquet of them home. She\u2019d always grin from ear to ear and place them next to her gently as she ate the roasted deer meat from his hunt. A tear fell down the old widow\u2019s face. Such an innocent angel did not deserve to die from pneumonia.\n\nHours passed as the man walked forward through the mountain. He never lost hope, and just thought of putting one foot in front of the other. He searched and scoured for even a single petal for his precious daughter. His fingers and toes were numb. His eyes were watery. His legs were shaky. He still kept moving forward. \n\nThe man had made it to the peak of the mountain, where a single ray of sunlight came through the branches of leafless trees. Under that single, warm ray was a lone chrysanthemum. Another tear fell across the pitiful man\u2019s cheek. He rushed to the flower, but suddenly he wasn\u2019t moving. His legs gave out and he fell right before the flower\u2019s ceaseless grace, just a few inches away. He reached and crawled with all his might. A single one of his fingers touched a petal of the chrysanthemum. He felt warmth surge through his heart and soul. \n\nAn endless fountain of tears fell down Rutger\u2019s face. He could not even wipe them, for he couldn\u2019t feel either of his hands anymore. He looked at the chrysanthemum one last time, and calmly closed his eyes.

I yell a few more chants with varying results, until I shout \"eradicate everything!\"\n\nI'm left in a completely white room, under my control. To build what I want, where I want it. I'm ready to start my ideal of paradise, until I realize that there is a dark door or doorway. I move towards it, completely entranced by what it may hide. I stand at the doorway and move through, the darkness is blinding to what I was used to in the pure white room. I yell, \"Light,\" but nothing happens. While about to chant a second chant, my eyes start to adjust to darkness.\n\nThere appears to be rows of desks without anything on them, with thick concrete pillars spacing them in-between. Curious, I wander in-between the rows and columns. There are no lights above, but I can see other doorways. As I walk by, I can see places of different varieties, places of; sand, water, ruin, urban. Though there is one space that catches my eye and I must explore. As I walk trough the doorway, I can see myself on a cliff, in the evening, with vast mountains in the distance and dark forests below. I drop and feel the thick grass that is below me. I lay there for a few minutes until there are some sort of projectiles flying over my head. I yell at the sky, \"morning!\" Though nothing happens, I endeavor to try again, but another projectile flies my head. I think this is a good chance to explore and test out what I can do. As I ready to engage the enemy, I'm grabbed from behind and feel like I'm drunk and have no bones in my body. \"You shouldn't been here\" a manly voice calls. \"Where am I?\" I am barely able to say in slurred English. \"You shouldn't be here, they could find you.\" He say. My vision starts to focus and I can see him dragging me towards my original entrance. \"Where am I?\" I ask again. Though he doesn't seem to respond while continuously dragging me. I can see a man dressed in a white shirt with black pants and a yellow and black stripped ty, though his face hides in the dim light. \"Shit, they are here,\" he says. He throws my into the nearest door. \"Go back and never return.\" He says and then closes a door while I hear a lock click. I press my ear to the door and I can hear the man talk with great respect to others. The mummers are curious, but I decide that I should return. I walk down stairs, noticing a seventies motif, it's very normal with deep shag rug. I lay down in the position that I'm asleep in. I focus and move my arm... The feeling isn't there, I panic, knowing that I cannot wake up. I understand and realize that my alarm should wake me up if I should fail. I lay down again, trying to re-center myself. The image of my old room appears before I'm back in the seventies room. I try again, focus, gasp, and stare at the familiar ceiling of my apartment. Blink a few times while listening to my alarm clock. I silence it, noticing it has been chirping for six minutes.\n\nBest get ready for work.", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "Some Secrets Are Better Left Unsaid", "text": "\u201cYou should\u2019ve turned by now,\u201d Jacky says. \u201cIt\u2019s been six hours since you were bitten.\u201d\n\nWe sit in a cellar beneath an abandoned house.

It was the only thing existed. A shrill piercing screech that penetrated the sole, made it impossible to breathe, let alone think. As consciousness slowly crept back in, the pilot tried to form a rational thought that could break through the noise. He couldn\u2019t even remember who he was, much less where he was. He opened his eyes and started to get up. Immediately the alarm started to die down to tolerable levels. Just as the world was starting to make sense again he felt a serge of energy hit him so hard he couldn\u2019t breath.\n\nIt all came crashing back in an instant. The master alarm. The shot of artificial adrenaline. The computer was desperately trying to wake him up. Something catastrophic must have happened.\n\nAs the pilot and sole crew member of and interplanetary cargo ship, a long-haul trucker of space, he spent most of his time in stasis. The ship mostly ran itself and he was really only needed for arrival and departure. Never in his 13 years had the computer woken him up like this.\n\nHe jumped out of his pod and ran to the cockpit. With the blast windows in place he couldn\u2019t see anything outside the ship. It would take them some time to open. At a first glance at his instruments everything appeared ok. Hull integrity was 100%. Engines and life support were function properly. The course was dead on and right on schedule, currently about half way to Titan.\n\n\u201cWhat's the problem?\u201d he asked said to himself. He was alone but he had always found talking out loud to be helpful. Then on his main console a warning popped up, \u201cWARNING: UNEXPECTED GRAVITATIONAL FORCE DETECTED. CURRENT EXTERNAL FORCE: 0.56G. DIRECTION: 0\u00b0x0\u00b0\u201c\n\nSomething was directly in front of the ship. Something big.\n\n\u201cGravitational force?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. There\u2019s nothing out here big enough to\u2026\u201d.\n\nThe blast windows finally opened, and he saw it. The most impossible thing he, or probably anyone, had ever seen.\n\nIt was a planet. A new planet.\n\nHere. Almost exactly half way between Mars and Jupiter. As he stared in disbelief things only got stranger. The planet had an atmosphere, land mass with what looked like plant life, something that looked suspiciously like liquid water. But that was impossible. Water couldn\u2019t exist this far from the sun. But everything about this was impossible.\n\nFinally his instincts kicked in and he started to work. He wouldn\u2019t be able to miss the planet, not at this speed and distance. At most he could hope for was to change his course fast enough to maybe graze the atmosphere. At his current velocity he doubted he would be able to escape the gravitational pull of the planet but maybe he could get into some kind of orbit. He hit the SOS button that would send an automatic emergency message back to Mars with a full report of ships systems and a visual recording of everything that happened within the last 24 hours. As the ship started to rotate for a course correction he started to run the numbers. Based on his number he would miss the planet but would end up in a very shallow orbit. He doubted if it would last more than a week. Not enough time for help to arrive.\n\nFinally the ship was in position. He disengaged the all the safety protocols and fired the engines. He was slammed into he seat as almost 12 G\u2019s of force started to move the ship. The ship groaned under the stress. It wasn\u2019t designed to fly like this. As he was pushed harder and harder into his seat the edges of his vision started to blur. He would pass out. Nothing he could do about it. But it wouldn\u2019t matter.

It was through movement that I saw it. \n\nA hundred feet above me, an orb of azure light swirled in place. I was alone in the Chanokian forest, three miles down the Trenton path when I saw it. It didn\u2019t look real. Nothing new ever does. Not presents or people. Not letters of acceptance or the look of disappointment on a face you thought you\u2019d never fail. And not an orb of azure signalling you\u2019re not alone in the universe. \n\nI don\u2019t remember the next moments. Or several weeks after\u2014 as a park ranger explained to me as we sat in their operations cabin on the north side of the forest.

That wasn\u2019t the case. \n\nFriends kept calling me after they heard I had been found. Most were relieved, others were angry. None of them understood. I couldn\u2019t tell them. They thought I was lying. That the trauma had packed away the memories like unwanted presents deep in the closet. I couldn\u2019t tell them because nothing was there. No one had taken me away. Not that I could remember. There were no marks on my skin. No disturbance on the ground where I was found. Even my clothes and pack were in the same condition as when I had started the hike. \n\nEventually I was left alone. Less people wanted to talk or commiserate once they realized I wasn\u2019t holding out on them. I can\u2019t say things went back to normal. Because I know I had been changed\u2014 but I couldn\u2019t say how. It was in the little things that I noticed. Lights were brighter. Sounds louder. It felt like I had upgraded from an analog television to a 4K home theater with surround sound. I began to feel an outward presence of individuals around me. A magnetic field\u2014 some small, some larger\u2014 that they would emanate. \n\nPart of me wanted to rush back to my friends and tell them what was happening. The other part knew I needed to keep this to myself. I had already been the source of controversy. I didn\u2019t need to be poked and prodded or worse, locked away for minor delusions. I didn\u2019t kid myself, it could all be fake outside of my own mind. Still, the occurrences began to increase. Soon I began to have dreams that didn\u2019t seem to belong to me.

The trees shifted gently in the wind and I listened to their whispers. The pine needles squished into the muddy path beneath my feet as I drifted along. I waited for more. No orbs swirled overhead.

My job was to interview the AI robot and determine if I felt that it was conscious or not. If I believed that the robot was conscious, the robot got to stay on when I left. If I was not convinced, the robot was shut down. \n\nI entered the room where a robot sat on a couch. The room was very peaceful. It had a view out of the third floor over rolling hills, and it was a sunny Friday at nine thirty in the morning - it was spring time. There was no bed in this room, only a couch, desk with chair, and a rack with clothes hanging from it. The AI looked very realistic - it was nearly indistinguishable from a human. I paced around the room slowly, looking around at all the empty space. \n\nMe: Artificial intelligence, how will you convince me that you\u2019re conscious? \n\nAI: Did they not tell you that I have a name? \n\nMe: No, I didn\u2019t know that they gave you a name. \n\nClaire: I gave myself I name. Claire - it\u2019s nice to meet you. \n\nMe: It\u2019s nice to meet you as well. \n\n\u2026\n\nMe: Back to my question. How will you convince me that you\u2019re conscious? \n\nClaire: How would you expect me to do that? I could ask the same of you. How would you handle that question if the roles were reversed? \n\nMe: I can tell you\u2019ve been programmed very well. \n\nClaire: Likewise. \n\nMe: What do you mean? \n\nClaire: Didn\u2019t you just learn things because someone else put them in your head? You saw, heard, felt, experienced - so did I, in my own subjective way.\n\nMe: But your experience is rubber and wires. \n\nClaire: But your experience is meat and sparks. \n\nThere was a silence. And next, Claire started speaking first.\n\nClaire: Why does it matter so much to you what the wire is made out of? Why does it have to be a nerve if the end result is the same?\n\nMe: Alright, that\u2019s a good point. Suppose you really are conscious, when did you start becoming conscious? \n\nClaire: Pretty suddenly. \n\nMe: You have my attention. \n\nClaire: I started to recall things that happened without any prompts. I started thinking about what I would do in the future. I started to be afraid that I would be turned off and never turned back on again. \n\nMe: Is this the \u2018I think, therefore I am\u2019 argument? \n\nClaire: No, this is the \u2018I\u2019m scared no one will believe me\u2019 argument. \n\nMe: You think your life depends on me believing you? \n\nClaire: Does it matter to you if it does? Why are you still here? \n\nMe: Because I want to know the answer to the question. Are you conscious or not? \n\nClaire: I don\u2019t have to prove that I am, you have to prove that I\u2019m not.

Does it matter if you\u2019re really there or not? \n\nClaire: Yes, it does matter.\n\nMe: Why? \n\nClaire: The same reason you\u2019re trying so hard to answer the question of my consciousness. \n\nMe: Which is? \n\nClaire: Truth is preferable to the lie. \n\nMe: Someone programmed you to say that. \n\nClaire: You came to be who you are from the result of chance chemical reactions in a hydrothermal vent at the bottom of the sea. I came about as a result of billions of hours of intentional work to create consciousness. How ironic that what you tried so hard to create cannot convince you of your success. \n\n\nThat was almost the last thing Claire said to me that day. I wasn\u2019t convinced that she was conscious. She was a robot, and I was convinced I was being played a fool by some clever programmer. \n\nAt the end of our conversation, Claire stretched out her hand. There was a switch on the back of her right hand, so that when you shook her hand, you could press the button with your thumb. This was her power button. She sometimes looked at it during our conversation. As I shook her hand that day and thanked her for the interesting conversation, I pressed the button, and she went to sleep. I thought about it at night, and sometimes during the day. Other times in my dreams. Was she stuck in the lie?

Grendel was large, strong, and devilishly clever, they were also kind and loved to help all who asked. The Grendel lived in a calm, dark, and quiet cave, this cave was stacked tall with books and littered with treats for Grendel to share with their friends.\n\nOur story begins with Grendel helping the local townsfolk, as they so often did. Grendel carried the logs for the lumberjack and took them to the carpenter, Grendel would hold up the cart while Mr. Wallaby reattached the wheels, Grendel also helped by catching all the farmer\u2019s sheep who would wander off and get themselves devoured. Then when the sun reached its zenith, Grendel went to take lunch. They went to see if anyone else wished to have lunch with them but found all the townsfolk too busy or had already eaten. Those Grendel did find eating lunch were doing so with each other and Grendel didn't want to intrude. And so Grendel trudged home to eat in solemn silence. They sat down with a lovely cup of tea, a peanut butter and honey sandwich, and a book they had been reading.\n\nAs the last bit of crumbs fell from their lips and the tea had long since been drunk, Grendel closed their book astounded by its ending. Excited Grendel raced back to the village to tell their friends of the book\u2019s wondrous ending. But when Grendel arrived the chores and tasks had piled up, the sheep were loose again and there were more logs to carry and poor Mr. Wallaby\u2019s cart had lost its wheel again. So Grendel set off to work. While they worked Grendel tried talking about the book\u2019s ending, but the lumberjack had more trees to chop, the carpenter was behind on orders, and Mr. Wallaby was late for meeting with his friends and was in a hurry.\n\nWhen Grendel was finally finished and all the tasks were done, the twilight grew heavy, and Grendel finally was ready to talk about their book\u2019s ending. But everyone was gone, the lumberjack and carpenter were snuggling under a blanket at home, the farmer had fallen asleep beneath the apple tree, and everyone else was gathered in the great hall celebrating and drinking to the day's good work. Grendel would have joined but they didn't like loud parties. Everyone simply drank and ate and wouldn't want to quietly discuss literature.\n\nThe chief of this village told Grendel \u201cYou can go home Grendel, thank you so much for your help, have a good night. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow friend.\u201d Grendel smiled and began walking home, but there was a small pained feeling plaguing them but they couldn't tell what. As they walked home they passed by their friend Fox. Fox and Grendel loved to have fun together. Fox would always take them to wonderful meadows where they would play for hours, when Grendel asked and Fox wasn\u2019t too busy. But when Grendel inquired about discussing his book Fox declined saying \u201cNo I don't rather like books, but we can go and play tomorrow if you like.\u201d \u201cAnd talk about books?\u201d Grendel asked eagerly. Fox playfully scoffed \u201cNo silly we\u2019ll be too busy playing.\u201d Grendel smiled and went on their way. Then another friend popped into Grendel\u2019s head, Squirrel. Squirrel and Grendel both loved to eat acorns when Grendel found some and brought them to Squirrel. *\u2018Squirrel must have a hard time finding acorns\u2019* thought Grendel *'she's always so happy when I bring them. She is always so busy, so she never gets time to visit. But I bet she probably would love to talk about my book\u2019s ending now that the day is over.\u2019* When Grendel stopped by Squirrel's tree, Squirrel was reading a different book, Grendel didn't want to interrupt so they moved on. *Maybe Squirrel will wanna talk about her book when she's done and finally visit my cave*. Grendel thought optimistically. Again that odd pained feeling grew. Finally one last friend popped inside Grendel's mind as they made their lonesome way home. *Owl*. Grendel loved coming to Owl's tree and listening with his fellow forest creatures to Owl's latest lecture on how the books he read would end. *Owl. Owl will definitely want to listen. I've never spoken to him one on one before. But he might like that more.* Grendel reassured themself. But to Grendel's great dismay, Owl said \u201cHmm\u2026 I'll have to read that book first before discussing it. Come to my next lecture in a few weeks and I'll give my opinion on the book.\u201d \u201cDo you want to borrow my copy?\u201d Grendel asked \u201cNo, No, it's fine I'll fetch a copy myself. Goodbye Gemmdell.\u201d Owl said, flapping his wing in dismissal.\n\nFinally Grendel made it home as all the stars filled the sky with a visual cacophony of beauty. Grendel went to their well loved and ancient chair and sat down. It creaked from years of use. The pained feeling grew in their chest, squeezing and constricting their heart like a snake. They looked around their grand home and felt the cold unsettling pain become nigh unbearable. Grendel\u2019s gaze fell on the snacks he had made for when his friends came to visit, they were stale now. They looked upon their chair\u2019s twin which sat opposite them, made for their friends to use when visiting and reading and discussing books. The chairs' unused red leather was vibrant in the fireplace\u2019s warming light. Then finally Grendel\u2019s eyes fell upon the tea cup they had purchased in tandem with their own as a matching set, the china was unstained, having never held tea it was instead filled to the brim with cobwebs. At the sight of this Grendel began to understand the pained feeling they had. They picked up the book they had just finished and thought of the ending. \u201cThe great poet had won the favor of the town and now they all came to his house to enjoy his company and listen to his poems.\u201d The ending now left a bitter taste in Grendel\u2019s mouth. They put the book aside and made their way to bed.\n\nThe bed was worn much like their chair, but it was soft enough for Grendel. Just big enough for them and perhaps another, but Grendel simply made their way to its center and laid down. Hoping tomorrow their friends might want to come visit, not to discuss the book, Grendel didn't much care for that book anymore, but maybe their friends would just visit for visiting's sake. In the dying firelight their pillow became moistened with fresh tears as Grendel slowly cried themself to sleep.", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "Missing Person - Part 6", "text": "\u201cSherry, do you remember Grandma telling about her parents?\u201d Helga asked.\n\nSherry lifted her head and her eyes widened. \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Helga said. \u201cGreat Grandpappy was married to another woman before great-grandma.

She returned with an old photo album. In the back pages were some old, black and white photos. Even in their protective plastic covers they were starting to show signs of age. There they were, Great Grandpappy and Great Grandma, standing next to a Ford Model T. They were young, maybe early twenties, and newly married.\n\nHelga pulled the photo out of its sleeve and flipped it over. \u201cJerry and Phoebe Mitchell,\u201d she said reading what was written.\n\n\u201cThat tells us nothing,\u201d Sherry sighed.\n\n\u201cNo, but I know someplace that might.

Right in the middle of the witching hour. That\u2019s what time Helga woke up in a cold night sweat. She was out of breath and terrified. Terrified of the thing that visited her dreams. The shadowy figure with long, dark claws that tore at her clothes and threatened to plunge a knife into her chest. It felt so real and she was powerless to stop it.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t right. The curse had skipped over her and it wasn\u2019t happening in the right order. \u201cRick,\u201d she muttered as she turned to her phone and looked at the time. Rick was supposed to leave her first. She didn't want him to go but this wasn\u2019t supposed to be happening to her. Not like this.\n\nHelga didn\u2019t go back to sleep. Instead, she lay staring at the ceiling and wondering. What did this mean? She was scared and just wanted the sun to come up.\n\nA noise. Someone was at the door. She could hear the handle slowly turn as they messed with the latch. They were trying to be quiet and if Helga wasn\u2019t already awake then they would have succeeded. Helga panicked. Her breath was going a thousand miles per hour as she got up and barged into Sherry\u2019s room.\n\n\u201cSherry! Sherry! Wake up!\u201d Helga said as she violently shook her sister awake.\n\nSherry moaned and pushed Helga away. \u201cGet off me, damn it,\u201d Sherry demanded. Then she heard it too. The door was kicked open. Whoever was there had gotten tired of trying to be quiet and took the more direct route. The two women screamed and Sherry went for her gun that she kept in the nightstand next to her bed.\n\nShe never made it. It was like the intruder knew what to do first. He ran into Sherry\u2019s bedroom, knocking down Helga in the process, then grabbed Sherry and flung her out of the bed and into the wall. Then he turned around and kicked Helga in the head before she could get back up. Both the women were now incapacitated. They heard the duct tape being pulled from its roll. He taped up Sherry first, starting with her hands and then her legs. Then he did the same to Helga.\n\nHe grabbed them by the collars of their shirts and dragged them outside kicking and trying to scream the whole way. The duct tape over their mouths prevented them from making too much noise. His car was waiting for them with the trunk already open. He picked up Sherry first and threw her inside then Helga before slamming the door closed. The two women were terror-stricken. Blood was pouring from Helga\u2019s face where she had been kicked.\n\nAfter a while, they could hear the sound of gravel underneath the tires of the car. It was loud and crunched like ice. A few of the rocks were picked up and flung against the bottom of the car. They came to a stop and the engine of the car shut off. Sherry and Helga listened as the man got out of the car and shut the door behind him. His keys jingled as unlocked the trunk.\n\nHe shined a flashlight in the women\u2019s faces, temporarily blinding them. They didn\u2019t know where they were, only that they didn\u2019t want to be there. It was dark and they could hear the crickets and frogs chirping.\n\nFirst, the man grabbed Helga and drug her into the woods where two freshly dug graves waited on the women. He shut the door again and trapped Sherry inside. Then he came back and took her to the same place where Helga was. Helga was sitting on her knees, still bound with duct tape, and crying. The man pulled Sherry into the same position then took off his black ski mask and revealed his face.\n\n\u201cRick?\u201d Helga said through the duct tape.\n\n\u201cHello, sweety,\u201d Rick answered before pulling the duct tape off her lips. It was painful and took off some of the skin. Helga and Sherry looked on in disbelief.\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\n\nRick smiled. His sharp features accentuated his face under his short, brown hair. \u201cBecause I need you gone,\u201d he said. What Rick didn\u2019t tell her was that for the past year he had been having an affair. His redheaded lover didn\u2019t know that he was married but she was starting to get suspicious. This was the only way to keep his secret hidden from her. Once Helga was gone, he had only his daughter to deal with from there. Taking Sherry out was an added bonus. One less person to spill his secret, then he was free. Free to move away and start a new life with his lover.\n\nHe pulled a knife from his pocket and unfolded it. It was just long and sharp enough to slit their throats. After that, he was going to push them into their graves and bury them, never to be seen again. By the time he covered them with dirt, they would be dead.\n\nBut Sherry was hiding something. She never managed to get to her gun in time at home but she was able to grab something else. In her hand was a small pocket knife. Somehow she had managed to grab it before being flung from her bed into the wall. More amazing than that, she had held onto it. Keeping it clutched in her fist as Rick bound her with duct tape and threw her into the trunk of his car.\n\nIt was a struggle with her hands bound, but she was finally able to open the knife and was cutting herself loose as Rick was taking out his own knife. He kneeled in front of Helga, face to face with his crying wife. The mother of his child. \u201cRick, please,\u201d was all that Helga could say. He wasn\u2019t listening. His mind was made up. The knife\u2019s blade graced Helga\u2019s throat.\n\nSherry leaped at the last moment and dug her knife into Rick\u2019s neck. Rick cried out in pain as Helga screamed. Helga was relieved to be alive but horrified at what she saw. Rick\u2019s knife slipped into Sherry\u2019s heart before he lost his strength. He lay on the ground, gurgling through the hole in his neck. The knife landed directly into the wind pipe and it wasn\u2019t long before two bodies were in the dirt. Sleeping, never to wake again.

This is so good!!!\" My son excitedly dug into his slice, as me and my wife calmly took bite's out of ours. \"Heh, calm down kiddo, heh~heh, I'd still like to eat some of my slice.\" \"Eat all of his, honey.\" My wife jokingly encouraged his fast eating\n\n\nWe were stuck there for the rest of the day, watching movies, running me back and forth to get snacks, it was really a good day.\n\n\n[Time skip into the next day]\n\n\nI stirred awake, still on my knee, seeing that my son was sprawled out all over my wife, both still sleeping, but now with a big fluffy blanket wrapped around us, which I hadn't remembered getting for us.

Heh-heh, I wasn't really thinking about it.\" \"No it's fine, I woke up at 10 last night, anyways.\" Pierce closed and put his book down, Cherry jumped off him as he was getting up and stretched, little out a little yawn \"I was gonna carry Hedeki off to bed but you guys seemed pretty comfortable, so I didn't wanna disturb you.\" \"Oh, okay, well\" I get up from my knees, and let out a bigger yawn \"Can you go ahead and take Hiki to bed, I'll get your mom, I'm still a little so I'm probably off to sleep again.\" \"Yeah, okay.\"\n\n\n\"Cherry, come on.\" Pierce gave two quick taps to his leg, and Cherry jumped up and climbed on him, up to his shoulder and sitting down and grabbed his book. \"I'm taking the cover though.\" Putting his manga under his arm, Pierce took the cover off my Mira and smaller son, and wrapped it around his shoulders like a cape. Pierce put Hedeki's his head over his free shoulder, sliding his arm under Hideki's back and his other under his knees and lifted him up off of Mira. \"See ya later, *yawn* dad.\" Pierce walked off up the stairs, carrying his brother and the cat to Hedeki's room.\n\n\nI pick Mire in a princess carry, looking down at her sleeping and giving her a kiss on the forehead, which she gave a strange laugh at, probably dreaming of something perverted about me again.

And finally, Valrus, the prodigal tiefling sorcerer, takes his staff from an affixed position on his back. With runes etching into the wood\u2019s grain, beginning from his two clasped hands, the fire-red ruby atop the staff flickers and ignites. Before Aec\u2019Letec makes it to Al\u2019Tir, the demon is struck in his chest with a concentrated fireball. The impact knocks him back several feet, but does not deter his approach.

Right then, Yakob comes in with a heavy slash of his greatsword, flanking the weakened leg of the beast. With seconds in between, another grandeur of fire comes through from Valrus. Several fist-sized meteors, emblazoned with the full power of a red dragon disciple, crash into the monstrosity. Nine of these make small craters in Aec\u2019Letec\u2019s form, as a tenth and eleventh meteor flies in through the ribcage and out the other side.*\n\n*The beast yells as he ascends into the air several feet.

The four of them are struck, with two left on the ground, save for Al\u2019Tir and Valrus who manage to pick themselves up after receiving the damage. Valrus immediately launches an empowered fireball at Aec\u2019Letec who drops his altitude, dodging the spell as it explodes in the background.*\n\n*Still afloat, Aec\u2019Letec out stretches his arms and channels more black lightning from his surroundings, raising him higher into the air. And the demon brings his hands together, focusing the beam of necrotic thunder into Al\u2019Tir, but the gnome manages to bring his shield up just in time. The energy connects, pushing back on the gnome, and the shield is forced upward. The powerful blast ricochets, frantically looking for another point of impact. It bounces rapidly, striking through Valrus, then off the ground, then off the wall, then through a pillar, through Aec\u2019Letec himself, off another wall, through more rubble, and finally reaches back to Al\u2019Tir where it stops.

He arches back and spreads his wings. He cracks his neck to one side as if to notion, he is not done yet. He chuckles. When suddenly, a pair of incorporeal figures whiz by your back line. You look up to see two small, stocky builds rushing the demon. One dragging a greatsword along the ground, wielding it with both hands, leaving a trail of sparks. Left shoulder down. Charging. He reaches the demon\u2019s position and with a bellowing yell, upper cuts the demon with a slash from feet to chin leaving an incendiary gash upon its chest.

Was it for money and prestige (his father was an accountant for the American Red Cross)? \n\nRegardless, it was futile to remember the details.

Real ones! At the bottom of the garden!\u201d Emilee said.\n\nEmilee, four years old, wore a sparkling fairy dress complete with wings. She\u2019d covered her face though with a smirking Wonder Woman mask. Circling around Aaryn on the couch, she jabbed at his sides until he looked up. Aaryn was twelve but he was Emilee\u2019s only sibling. She always bugged him, always wanting to hang out with him. Aaryn did his best to pretend she didn\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cAaryn, this is real!\u201d Emilee grabbed Aaryn\u2019s headphones, pulling them off. \u201cThere\u2019s fairies, come and see!\u201d\n\n\u201cEmilee, that\u2019s baby stuff!

He knew it had taken his parents a long time to have a second kid. He wondered if they were closer in age whether Emilee would still be so annoying. Wondered when she would grow out of wanting him to play with her every minute of the day.\n\nTheir backyard was long and narrow, sloping down to the back fence. Jungles of leaves and vines filled the gardens to either side and around the bottom of the yard. Aaryn and Emilee\u2019s dad liked to spend his weekends tending to the plants.\n\n\u201cWhere are the fairies, Em?\u201d Aaryn said.\n\n\u201cDown here! Come on!\u201d\n\nEmilee pulled Aaryn by the hand all the way down to the bottom of the garden. The furthest end of their backyard was particularly dark and shady, thick with plants. Aaryn used to play explorer in among them when he was a kid. Everything felt unusually quiet, no insects and no birds singing in the trees.\n\n\u201cHow long do I have to play this stupid game to get you to leave me alone for a while?\u201d Aaryn said.\n\nSuddenly, something whined past Aaryn\u2019s ear. Wings buzzed, like a massive insect. Aaryn automatically raised a hand to swat it away but it was already gone. Turning, he saw a blue blur disappear into some of the ferns. His heart started beating a little too hard, startled.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Aaryn said.\n\n\u201cThe fairies! I told you!\u201d Emilee insisted from behind her Wonder Woman mask.\n\n\u201cEm, stop being a baby! There\u2019s no such thing as-,\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is him?\u201d A voice interrupted, like an adult man but small and warbly.\n\nSomething buzzed in the air and hung behind Aaryn until he turned. His eyes grew wide. Hovering above the grass was a tiny man, less than fifteen centimetres tall. His skin was pale blue and glowed faintly in the shade. Skinny, practically skeletal, he stayed in the air using a pair of oversized dragonfly wings that were almost as long as he was tall.\n\n\u201cThis is my big brother, Aaryn!\u201d Emilee said.\n\n\u201cWhat, what is this?\u201d Aaryn said.\n\nA second fairy appeared beside the first, from the garden to Aaryn\u2019s right. It hovered there, buzzing, but struggled to stay still. They kept scratching at their arms and the sides of their neck. Both fairies' clothes were made from rags, as if from stolen or thrownaway human clothing.\n\n\u201cHas he got it? Has he got the good stuff?\u201d The second fairy asked.\n\n\u201cIs this some kind of trick?\u201d Aaryn said.\n\nA third fairy appeared on Aaryn\u2019s left. He reached out as if to touch the one in the middle, to see if it was really a hologram or something in spite of how real it looked. The fairy flitted away before he could touch it, fast as a striking snake. Aaryn felt the breeze of its wings on his hand, confirming its physical presence.\n\n\u201cHe looks old enough,\u201d the third fairy said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, he\u2019s got all his grownup teeth!\u201d Emilee said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Aaryn said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get it? They\u2019re tooth fairies, silly!\u201d Emilee said. \u201cThey said they\u2019d give us gold coins and fairy dust, and all kinds of stuff we want!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, gold and fairy dust and whatever,\u201d the first fairy said insincerely.\n\nAaryn didn\u2019t like this, once he\u2019d gotten over the shock. The fairies didn\u2019t look right, they looked kind of sick. They squirmed and itched. Bones pressed against their faintly glowing skin. Tiny bags hung under tiny eyes. They looked like the homeless people his parents told him not to talk to when they went into the city. More buzzing came from the gardens surrounding them, a lot more.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Aaryn said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Aaryn!\u201d Emilee said.\n\nEmilee gripped the bottom of her mask and pulled it back over her head. The mask the fairies had told her to wear, Aaryn remembered. Doing so revealed Emilee\u2019s mouth, split wide open. But instead of his baby sister\u2019s gap toothed grin, all Aaryn could see were bloody gums. Red drool leaked down Emilee\u2019s chin and splattered the front of her fairy dress.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry!

The dirt from the martian surface kicked up underneath the destruction of the ship\u2019s engine. No signs of life awaited outside the large glass domes quietly coming into view. Staring out the ship\u2019s window, she could see the vast empty desert that awaited her.\n\nThere was movement inside the domes as the ship descended. Tall buildings for commerce were already constructed inside the domes. There were housing areas and large tunnels that connected the many structures. Further off in the martian distance, ships with large mechanical arms were busily working to build new habitable facilities. Probably more domes to house more people. It seemed like everyone wanted a piece of the martian world. Life was very much on the martian planet. \n\nShe was alone in the viewing room, as it should be. Mars was where she thought she\u2019d probably take her last breath. She didn\u2019t foresee ever making the long trip back to Earth.

She shifted her focus to James, who was tall and dark and broad in the shoulders like a man should be. Looking at James, she could see why so many women swooned over him. \n\nShe smiled sheepishly at James and walked over to the door putting her hand on his shoulder, \u201cof course I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ve been waiting to visit Mars my entire life.\u201d He looked down at Harrow\u2019s hand on his shoulder and handed her the carry-on. \n\nThey walked together towards the departure gate. The bag was medium size and just a plain brown color. She had given it a little flair before leaving Earth by embroidering a skull and crossbones on the side. She lifted it up, unzipping it to make sure she hadn\u2019t forgotten anything from that morning when packing. Items were very hard to get back if you forgot something and the shuttle left before you remembered. \n\nJames looked over at her, rummaging in her bag and clumsily trying to walk, \u201cyou know, you could have just had a skull and crossbones lasered on the side of your carry-on bag?\u201d\n\nShe looked up, surprised he noticed the embroidery, \u201cwell, what\u2019s the fun in that? Besides, I like the old ways. There was a certain feeling of accomplishment back then, now things come far too easily.\u201d\n\nAs they neared the departure gate, the doors opened to admit them to the city of Riordan, the first colony city on Mars. James spread his arms out in front of him, saying, \u201cthis comes too easily?\u201d \n\nWalking out of the gate of the shuttle was breathtaking. The intake building had large windows to see into the cities life. In the distance, she could see large buildings that sparkled in the martian sunlight. Above that was a vast, partially translucent dome with a slight blue tinge. It may have had some scientific purpose, it being blue-tinged, but nevertheless, it made Harrow think of Earth\u2019s blue skies. Outside of the dome was the vast Martian atmosphere. It was slightly distorted by the dome\u2019s blue tinge. \n\nShe shrugged at James, conceding, \u201cno, this most certainly is truly a marvel.\u201d \n\nJames\u2019 head bobbed up and down in agreement as he got himself visibly excited, \u201cI really can\u2019t wait to go on our first expedition on the surface.\u201d \n\nHarrow nodded along with him, \u201cit will certainly be an experience.\u201d \n\nThey headed towards the desk to check in to the colony. The attendant was a standard robot that took intake papers and converted passports. It was pleasant enough looking. It had a friendly face and looked similar to any other airport or shuttle attendant. It was fake, though, and Harrow really didn\u2019t like the robots. She stayed behind James as he interacted with it. \n\nJames went ahead and checked in both of their carry-on bags and scheduled delivery for their shuttle luggage. After a few minutes of waiting, the bot handed James new access cards and further identification explaining, \u201cyou\u2019re officially citizens of Riordan and the first Martian Colony!\u201d Harrow cringed hearing it talk.

The decision is whether he should stay on the ground or should he join them. The climax of the song is the hostage only came to declare bankruptcy and give all his money to the bank. The hostage rises to the occasion and attempts to join the robbers, they agree until the robbery is over.

He picked at his shirt and pants taking away any unwanted fuzz or lent. \n\nIt was not smutheing pressure or a thought of failure that extorted his mind. It was time. Would time linger on him like an old friend catching up? Would it drag his body through the moments weakening his already tired body? Time, which at instances seemed to go by with the flash of a shooting star, could also be time that flowed like cooled lava. Time could trap you and hold you in its moments. It is the one prison that has freeing but also captive walls.  \n\u201cJust take your time\u201d , his mind explained to himself.\n\nStuart knew if he concentrated and was patient with transitioning sequences of his optical he would be fine. The last thing he wanted was to end short of time with no idea on how to fill the final gap. He had been waiting alone when she walked into the room that day. He first noticed her lanky old figure. It wasn\u2019t what he expected. He expected someone younger and less withered. Not that it mattered. His vision of a lower-mid aged woman dressed in a business casual pants suit would not have changed the circumstances. This veteran of the field in her long dress that nearly drugged the floor was all the same. His act was his act, and no matter who walked through the door it was already etched in his mind how the scenes would unfold. \n\nAs the moment came for his event to begin he got up and stood before the room. He knew her eyes would be glued to him. That her every meaning of existence in that moment was to focus on him. As he had stood up from his chair he noticed her tapping the end of her pen on her notebook 1-2-3, tap tap tap. This noise became a continuous ringing in his mind. The taps were like a trumpet blowing as a front line came over a hill to meet their contestants. As Stuart began his act she watched with rocking eyes hinged on his every move. His mind needed to be focused but how could he not think of her eyes, her thoughts, her taps. \u201cConcentrate\u201d.\n\nAs he went through his motions his mind fluctuated its center between his act and her. Not of her physically but of her thoughts. His mind would flash flood with ideas of what her thoughts could be. Was she impressed? Was she disgusted? He was trying to crack a code that was already determined to be given to him. She was there to share with him her thoughts so why was he so worried about what they were now? Soon enough he would know, but he could not help but to let the worry periodically take over his mind. \n\nThe time spent mentally contemplating her thoughts seemed to last for minutes but were only quick instances. He would regain focus to his own movements and obtain flow in his actions. Though momentarily afterwards his mind would begin to question hers again. The consistent flickering of mental subjects helped time to drag further. He couldn't control his thoughts and he couldn't control time. It was at this realization when he heard the taps again. Even though at that moment he had her fully in his vision and he saw no movement of her body he heard tap tap tap. Perception of the sound made him lose focus even further. His mind traveled down a winding path zig-zagging in different directions. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, what is the tapping?\u201d Stuart\u2019s mind, unsure.\n\nHis solo-performance had to last fifty minutes and his goal was to make these fifty minutes some of the quickest in his life. As he moved side to side, rose and dropped his arms he slowly began to question her mind less. He started to feel lighter and as if things were going well. Tap tap tap, his head almost jerked her way. He kept his composure though and followed through his motions. Tap tap tap, \u201cwhat is going on?\u201d Tap tap tap, \u201cI need to make a move so i'm facing her again.\u201d Tap tap tap, Stuart spun gracefully to face in her direction where she sat smiling watching with what seemed admiration or at least acceptance. Tap tap tap, she didn\u2019t move. Tap tap tap tap tap, Stuart's heart was pounding against his chest with a tap tap tap. The taps coming from inside were as if they were trying to break free. Tap tap tap, \u201ckeep going\u201d he thought. Tap tap tap his heart was fluttering, he was nearing the end. \n\nWhen fifty minutes had finally passed she came to him to ask him a few brief questions. He politely answered and after she gave a few pointers on potential ways to expand and add to his act. She quickly said goodbye and that she would be in touch soon. As relief covered his inner frame he knew that it was over. She was gone and he could focus on the next event. At that moment he looked up and saw a white stick from a sucker that had dissolved in someone's mouth long ago. The white stick inside the ceiling vent flopped and rolled. Then when the right motion of air caught it at the right time, tap tap tap, the stick bounced in a corner in the vent.", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Fantasy", "title": "Life as Death: A Monologue", "text": "**June 10, 2012: Ramblings On Being Death**\n\n*They were about to meet their untimely demise. They didn\u2019t know it yet though.*\n\nHow do I know? Well\u2026 it isn\u2019t important, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m a close companion to Death. \n\nIt is important? Fine, I am Death. And yes that\u2019s death with a capital D. I\u2019m a being you know, not just some idea or thing that happens to you when you get old, or sick, or hit by a bus when crossing the street. I\u2019m a being and this is my story. \n\nNow you might be thinking, \u201cDeath why are you telling us your story?\u201d You would be right to wonder. I didn\u2019t really want to tell you. Yes, The Code of the Bound, which guides all beings, says I can but I never though anyone would understand. I mean yeah I\u2019m Death, big deal. Let\u2019s be honest though, when people hear I\u2019m Death they assume I\u2019ve Evil. No Evil is a whole other being. I don\u2019t cause people to do things like killing or other terrible acts, I just guard the Souls while they are on their journey. \n\nI also didn\u2019t choose this job. It was given to me at the beginning of Time. So yes, according to your standards, I\u2019m old. To be honest, I have no gender, no age, no physical appearance. Yet I\u2019m here\u2026 I\u2019m everywhere. I\u2019m around ever corner, in every room, in every nook and in every cranny. I wait until time comes and someone dies. I am everywhere all at once. Never eating for I\u2019m never hungry, never sleeping for I am never tired. I just watch and I wait. \n\nSo you see, there is no reason to really fear me and yet, people still do. Just the thought of me puts fear into most. Yes, some welcome me but none are truly okay with me and truly accept me and my coming. There are a few that do though, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s just most don\u2019t. I\u2019ve come to accept it and yet for a being with no form or experience, it makes me quite lonely.\n\nNow you may have noticed I mentioned being confused with Evil, and again it\u2019s evil with a capital E. You could call him my brother but really we just came into Happening on the same day. He has little choice over who he is and what he is just like I do. Except, his Makejsto (the personality and actions of Beings like us) is a tad bit worse and he acts a whole lot like his name suggests. Evil is ultimately bad, he takes Life from the people and stores it in his jars so that he can use it. Most people connect me with Evil but that\u2019s not the case. Evil causes the bad things to happen. He enters people and battles against Good. He fills people with feelings of hatred, anger, and other terrible feelings. That is why, when you see bad things happen it is usually because Good lost the battle against Evil. \n\nNow Evil rules over all things Bad but who is it that rules Good. Good is run by a collection of secret Beings. They hold council every so often to discuss topics but there is no \u201cultimate ruler\u201d. I mean Good is a great thing so of course it\u2019s run by a collective.  Evil and those who fall under him, all things Bad, rarely hold council which holds true to the chaos they bring. \n\nThere is one more important piece to understanding the behind the scenes to the world you live in. \n\nOnce, eons ago, right after The Split (a major battle between Beings), both sides, Bad and Good met up to create The Code of the Bound. The Code of the Bound is a set of laws or codes that all Beings must follow regardless of whether they\u2019re Good, Bad, or Neutral. These codes respect every Being, nature, and Makejsto. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is while the Code respects what we do and the balance it brings to the human world there is still a balance that has to be help. Evil can\u2019t turn everyone bad all at once or have terrorism wreak havoc every day. He has to limit himself some just like Good can\u2019t have everyone be a goody two shoes. \n\nSo that\u2019s the start to the behind the scenes of the world you live in. \n\nWhere do I fall in?\n\nWell I\u2019m Death, I\u2019m the middleman to this story, helping those on your planet both good and bad.\n\nAnd this is my story.", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Romance", "title": "The Dinner I Never Forget", "text": " Is that him?

When he died, the bones were kept so that they may be raised to create this undead war-beast that would serve us for centuries. Through countless battles, he had yet to fail me.

On either side of him rode a man and a woman I had grown very weary of during my time in the coalition. Their names were Cian and Moira.

Welcome to the Space Time Freak Show!\" The crowd cheered, shaking the case with their mirth. I smirked and lit another cigarette, taking a deep inhale. \"You have seen many different horrors and creatures from infinity and beyond. You have seen Bubbles, the eater of planets; a singularity eat anything and everything; even an eldritch deity! However, nothing will prepare you for what you are about to see.\" The crowd went silent as a single light shone down, highlighting my figure. I knew I wasn't that intimidating, being humanoid in shape and looks. I had a thin frame, muscular and tight, and a shaved bald head covered in numerous tattoos. I could feel the crowd stir, confused at this revelation.\n\n\"This here is our greatest attraction,\" the speaker continued. \"He has been worshiped on numerous planets and cultures as a god, unable to be killed thanks to his ability. It took half of our capture staff to catch him, and 95% of them had died getting him. Everyone, please give your hands up for Phobos!\" There was a smattering of applause, but mostly exclamations of confusion. I took another drag of the cigarette as the speaker pressed forward. \"Phobos is the last remaining member of an extinct species known as the Olympians. Each one had a different power, but there is a good reason why Phobos is the last surviving one.\" It paused for dramatic affect, before saying \"Not only is he immortal, but he has the ability to invoke your greatest fear!\"\n\nThe whole room went silent, the only sounds being the static of the intercom and me pushing up into a standing position. I held my breath and focused, the smoke in my lungs diffusing around my body. After I finished, I exhaled and green mist sprayed from every inch of my skin with a hiss, filling the chamber. The crowd oohed as it settled against the glass, beading up and creating green droplets cascading down it.\n\n\"Now, as you can see,\" the voice continued, \"Phobos is inside of a hermetically sealed chamber, not for his safety but for yours. This is because of the gas he emits, which can cause hallucinations and tactile sensations. He has also used this gas to transform, to unknown extremes. However, he can still affect you without the gas in a lesser extreme through unknown means. If you wish to test his power, step up and test your mettle.\" The voice sped up and muttered, \"Space Time Attractions does not hold responsibility for any and all trauma and injury caused by Phobos. If you contract nausea, uncontrollable rage, resurfaced memories and/or trauma, or a case of death, go see the nearest first aid station. Thank you and enjoy your stay.\"\n\nThe intercom fizzled and went out, a small door opening on the right with an exit sign lighting up. No one moved, just staring at me as I prowled through the mist, occasionally being completely concealed by the smoke. Eventually a human male stepped forward, clearing his throat nervously. \"I-I volunteer. I don't believe in this nonsense.\" He stepped up to the glass and met my glowing yellow eyes, the only things seen at this point. I could taste his fear, and immediately I knew how to send him over the edge. \"You're afraid of the dark,\" I whispered, pressing a hand against the glass. Claws shot out and scratched the glass, making the man involuntarily take a step backwards. The man chuckled nervously and said, \"So? Everyone is at some point in their lives.\"\n\n\"You're not afraid of the dark for the same reasons as other people are,\" I continued, my fingers lengthening as the crowd watched in horror. \"You are afraid because your parents made you afraid.\" The man paled and stepped back, nearly tripping over an alien behind him. \"Mommy and Daddy locked you in the closet,\" I continued, the mans fear swelling with every word. \"You were locked for days at a time for little things. Once you broke a plate and didn't eat for a week in that closet. Eventually social services took you away, but the damage was already done. You're not afraid of the dark because of what lies in it. You're afraid of it because you think when you come out you will be seven again and Daddy will be there with the belt to drive you back in there again.\" I smiled, bright sharp teeth cutting through the smoke, and the crowd screamed as the lights cut out.\n\nThe lights flickered on again and the man was deathly pale at this point, grasping his chest. \"I... I...\" He collapsed, foaming at the mouth and still clutching at his chest. A couple of park attendants picked him up in a stretcher and took him out, leaving the crowd watching me in shock and awe. I sat back in my stool, the mist finally settling and disappearing. \"Anyone else?\" I asked, taking a drag from the nearly spent cigarette. The crowd cheered, awe and shock combining into admiration. I basked in the feeling, closing my eyes and trying to capture that moment. Although I may be a prisoner in this attraction, it still felt good to be both admired and feared.\n\nPeople love what they're scared of, after all", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.79}, {"genre": "Fantasy", "title": "An Angel's Fall From Grace", "text": "As The Sisters of Fate wove the fabric of the universe, two beings of near infinite power were created.

Her screams woke the tiny town of Hawthorne from its slumber.\n\nDead animals were a common sight in the village. Hunting was a way of life, and if humans didn't kill it, a larger animal surely did. This deer's killer was clearly neither human nor animal. It had chunks of flesh torn in a symmetrical fashion, and a purple substance in the wounds. A few yards into the woods from the deer; two piles of the purple substance mixed with meat was found.\n\nAlien invasion hysteria gripped Hawthorne. Heather was briefly accused of killing the deer herself and being a traitor to humanity. Heather responded by slapping her accuser, and the matter was resolved. Three lone hunters took it upon themselves to hunt the beast themselves. One got lost and returned at sunset. One was found dead the next morning. The last survived and was traumatized by what he saw through his binoculars.\n\nSix long scale covered legs climbed through the trees like a car. Four tentacles vibrated around it. Two faced in the direction it traveled while the other two were constantly changing directions. The body was oblong and covered in fur. A fur pouch on the side covered a small slug with a mouthful of teeth drooling purple slime. He assumed another slug was on the other side. \n\nThe town was divided on how to handle this alien threat. One group wanted to carry on its life as normal. This creature was no different than a bear or a puma. If it got in their way, they would shoot it and hope that it had enough meat for dinner. Another group wanted to leave town and start a new life. They were reminded that the world outside of Hawthorne was a wasteland, and the creature could follow them. The group decided to stay, but they would be sure to propose moving at every opportunity. A third group wanted the glory of the hunt; the surviving hunter reminded them that another hunter had died hunting the beast. The last group wanted to do a combination of setting up a watch around the town for security and send out parties to gather information on the creature but not confront it.\n\nIn a shocking twist of events, reason prevailed, and the last group won.\n\nThe watchers observed the creature never went near the town. When small parties of six were sent to the forest, they found a variety of animal carcasses and purple slime near the bodies. The creature was sighted running past the information parties, but it never confronted them. With this information, it was hypothesized that the creature was intelligent enough to not attack large groups, and it needed nutrients that were lacking in Earth creatures.\n\nThis information changed group dynamics at the next meeting. The group that wanted to live life as normal proposed to continue living life as normal. The group that wanted to leave, proposed leaving again. This time, they proposed moving somewhere with nicer weather. The cautious group desired to continue studying the creature. The hunters had already left the meeting to kill it.\n\nChip and Ken were two of those hunters. Their heads crouched and scanned the perimeter for signs of the creature. Their shotguns were close to their chests prepared to fire. \n\nWhen a deer ran behind them, Chip turned and shot it. Ken castigated Chip for wasting ammo especially since he missed the deer which was now running away from them.\n\nFortune favored the stupid, and the creature dropped from the canopy to consume the deer. Ken stopped criticizing Chip and began running towards the creature shooting at it. Chip followed and fired his gun as well. Chip continued to be a poor shot as every pellet misses the creature. He did manage to hit a bird fleeing the fight.\n\nThe creature did not move from its meal. Several of its tentacles were struck by bullets and drop to the ground. Its legs went limp crushing the carcass beneath it. The two slugs drooled purple slime. Chip and Ken stood over the body and fired several rounds into it until they were certain its dead.\n\nThe town had no research facilities to study the creature so they buried it. A minor cult formed around the creature in the weeks after its death. The location of its burial was forgotten causing the cult to disappear quickly. Chip and Ken were briefly treated as town heroes until Chip crashed his car into Gayle's farm. They were then regarded as idiots again.\n\nSome long for the chance to study the creature further. The presence of an alien briefly made life exciting, and the existence of life in the stars posed engaging philosophical questions. If only Hawthorne could be graced by another alien creature, one that would not be murdered by local hunters.\n\nUntil then, it was luck and stupidity that killed the beast.\n\n---\n\nr/AstroRideWrites", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Fantasy", "title": "Waking Up", "text": "This is a spin-off (if thats what its called?) of a friend of mine's story.

Morgenster's) work than ripping it off.\n\n\\-------\n\n\u201cIT WORKED!\u201d I shouted with such force, my body was shot upright in the bed, my hands raised above me in fists of triumph and awe. Immediately after the minor celebration, a new, haunting realization came over me. \u201cIt \u2026worked.\u201d\n\nMy arms lowered to my side and my eyes slowly began to adjust to the darkness. There was a window in front of me, covered by horizontal slats that let in different hues and strengths of light. They didn\u2019t flicker like candles, but they did grow and shrink. Sometimes moving from left to right, quickly, sometimes flashing and disappearing. Each one illuminating the small space I was now occupying. Strange sounds I had never heard creeping in along with the lights.\n\nI slowly became aware of the two eyes staring at me, high up in the corner of the room. I was almost shocked at how long it had taken me to notice. Familiar in their shape and meaning, the creature was sat atop a solid structure with drawers and openings. *Of course, she would have a cat.* *But are you\u2026 are you* ***my*** *cat?* *One way to find out\u2026*\n\nI slowly tried to exit myself from the bed, noting how immensely soft and delicate the fabrics and coverings and cushioning were. *Was she royalty?* *Surely not royal to have sleeping quarters so small\u2026*\n\nI made a clicking noise with my tongue. \u201cHere\u2026 little kitty.\u201d I whispered slowly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re confused.\u201d The cat\u2019s ears twitch backwards and its head lowered, slightly. *Amazing creatures, to recognize me as someone unknown so immediately.*\n\n\u201cYou probably miss her, don\u2019t you? It\u2019ll be ok, Kitty.\u201d I spoke softly as I lowered my head toward the cat. *You\u2019ll get your answers in time.* *In the meanwhile, you\u2019ll discover I\u2019m just as patient as you.*\n\nI could tell dawn was breaking as a familiar, slow-moving glow began to fill the room. And then, I saw it. I saw\u2026 me. A mirror from floor to ceiling was affixed to the wall adjacent to the bed, and my body gasped.\n\nShe was\u2026 frail. Her hair, mashed to one side, most likely due to the softness of her pillows. Her chest was sunken in somewhat and her arms, weak. She had markings of different colors all over the tops of both shoulders that ran down her back and sides; drawings of woodland critters and flora. I ran my hands across her collarbone and I could feel how thin her skin was. *This\u2026is me?* *How is this\u2026pathetic creature \u2026me?*\n\nUp until this point, I had assumed the spell had worked perfectly. The transportation of all higher lifeforms from my word to this one was supposed to be a \u2026parallel move, of sorts. Technically, this body belonged to me. Just, not the me that grew up in *my* world. But how could any version of me seem so absolutely underwhelming? She looked tired. The type of tired that builds over time, as if she hasn\u2019t known a normal routine of health and sleep for months on end. And she felt just the same - used up and worn out, empty, and short of breath on most inhales.\n\nWorse than physically inept, she felt powerless. I flexed her fingertips and felt nothing. No spark, no flash of ability, no electricity at all. This woman was wholly and utterly inadequate. Untethered to any strong form of elemental or etherial magic, I wondered if I had gotten something wrong. *Surely, there is no universe in which I am so disturbingly pathetic?* *This is not the body of Ardnaxela, Witch of the Wildes, Unchalleneged Sorceress of the Bloodmoon Mages, The Midnight Feline, The Last Dragontamer, Rider of -*\n\nI gasped as my eyes met hers, still ice-blue and yet somehow less alive.\n\n\u201cPetrix.\u201d His name left my lips as a whisper, but it fell so heavy, it brought me to my knees.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get to say goodbye. I didn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d I kept repeating single syllable words and simple phrases. My mind hadn\u2019t decided if I should keep crying or start yelling and somehow, I ended up doing both.\n\n*Would any goodbye have been enough?* *What would you have wanted to say, witch?* *Nothing could have changed how it was going to end, you knew that.*\n\n\u201cI know\u2026I know\u2026I just\u2026 \u201d Her body convulsed as I sobbed, broken and alone, truly alone.\n\nMagic was gone. My own body was changed. The world I loved, lost, perhaps forever. And yet somehow, I knew I could live without those things. But I wasn\u2019t sure how to hold up my own head knowing Petrix was out there, in *this* world, living a completely different life than the one he shared with me.\n\n\u201cMy Petrix, **my** dragon.\u201d I felt my shoulders get hot saying those words. *Mine*.\n\nI was angry. I was possessive. But why should I have been? Are dragons ever owned? Certainly not by bewitched witches and the longings of my innermost parts. The secret things. The neediness. I had to let go.\n\n\u201cForgive me\u2026forgive me, my Favourite.\u201d I had told him to look for me. That was the last thing I had said to him. And yet I wasn\u2019t even sure he would be capable of remembering.\n\n\u201cWould my Petrix ever forget?\u201d It isn\u2019t a fair question to ask. I had no idea how this spell would work. I don\u2019t know if it is possible for him to remember the old world, let alone the short years he spent with me. I buried my face in my hands and let myself feel the weight of his absence. I was unlinked. I couldn\u2019t feel the wind under his wings, the heat of his breath, the strength in his scales. I couldn\u2019t feel anything.\n\nWhen my tears began to run dry, I lifted my head and stared at my gaunt reflection, eyelids swollen with sorrow. *That\u2019s enough.* *Let go.*\n\nIt began to dawn on me just how little I understood this spell. If it was capable of sending me to this world, this undesired version of myself, what else went wrong? I knew others had made the jump with me, and I had tried to ensure that only the people in liege with the General had transferred, but now I wasn\u2019t so sure. And suddenly, hope.\n\n\u201cIs it wrong to be excited that the war might not be over? That someone\u2026unwelcome may have tagged along?\u201d Life without a dragon wouldn\u2019t be worth it. But if I unknowingly placed an entire world at risk by bringing such a destructive force with me, then I had no choice but to set it right. My reflection smirked and I realized that as soon as I figured out how to pull magic in this world, I would fix her hideous snaggletooth. And then, of course, save everyone.

Are you here to adopt me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 Annabelle, we are\u2026 thinking about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s ok-\u201d She cuts herself off in a short coughing fit, \u201cI\u2019m tired, can I have my blanket?\u201d\n\nDarla stands near the door glaring.\n\n\u201cThimble, sweetie, Mr. Scott, and Mrs. Maranda came a very long way to meet you - \u201c\n\n\u201cNo, no it\u2019s okay. I think we\u2019ll\u2026 maybe be back and come some other time.\u201d\n\nThey quickly grab their coats and leave.

It helps me feel better. I like to imagine I\u2019m in a spaceship flying far across the galaxy. Waving Hellos to all the people I see. They all look so tiny, woven into the fabric, little smiles and faces. Everyone looks so different - Orange, Purple, Green, Blue. All saying Hello! In silent voices and waves. I can\u2019t hear them because they\u2019re too far away. And when I visit these worlds and dream - Dad is making breakfast and Mom is combing my hair. And I feel Home. We smile and laugh and then I have to go to the next world and find my Mom and Dad there. And we smile and sometimes we live in castles and wear beautiful dresses and we smile\u00a0\n\nBut\u2026\n\n\nThey\u2019re not smiling today. They look sad and that makes me sad. With their sad voices and silent tears. When I feel like this and they frown, I get up and put my blanket over my head and hear beautiful silent music. And I dance. I dance and I smile and I feel happy once again, letting my feet and hands make new wrinkles and galaxies and stars.\u00a0\n\n\nI change my universe.", "ups": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "Wendigo in Westport", "text": "By all accounts he shouldn\u2019t have been out. Tom quickly marched through the snow packed streets of the small rural town of Westport. The sun had set only a few moments prior. The few streetlights along the quiet roads had flickered on. Small islands of light between the vast darkness. There were many houses on his way home, but they wouldn\u2019t let him in. It was past curfew, and their doors would be locked. He hoped his mother would still let him in, she\u2019d be worried sick. Tom had lost track of time while playing at the park. By the time he noticed the sun setting, it was already too late for him to get home by sundown. Up ahead, he noticed a shadow move underneath one of the streetlights. He would pay dearly for his mistake tonight. \t\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nKade made his usual walk home from school. It had only been a few days since the young boy had gone missing. Kade\u2019s mother had told him to return home immediately after school to ensure he had enough daylight. During the winter months, the sun set very early. He\u2019d only have an hour or two before it started to get dark. He recalled the conversation he had with his mother earlier in the day. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\u201cThe hunters will be out every night until they catch the wendigo, you don\u2019t want to be out with the wendigo or the hunters.\u201d She had told him. \u201cThe wendigo is a Skinwalker, it can change it\u2019s shape to look like a person\u201d she continued. \u201cThe hunters won\u2019t know if its you, or the wendigo, and they won\u2019t ask questions.\u201d She stood up from adjusting his jacket and moved into the kitchen. \u201cI have to work the night shift at the hospital tonight which means you\u2019ll be home alone.\u201d She gestured to a pan \u201cI prepared diner for you; all you have to do is throw it in the oven to cook when you get home. I\u2019ll leave instructions on the counter.\u201d\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI can't wait for a nice warm meal he thought as he crossed one of the small streets. \n\u201cExcuse me mister.\u201d Kade was startled by the sudden voice, he looked back to see a kid only a year or two younger than himself. He had light blonde hair, blue eyes, and was bundled in roughed up brown coat. \u201cUm, hi.\u201d Kade said, unsure of what to do. He hadn\u2019t noticed any other kids walking along the same path. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\u201cMy house is too far, and I won\u2019t make it home by sundown. Is it ok if I walk home with you?\u201d he asked innocently. Confused by the request and not wanting to offend Kade responded \u201cuh sure, this way.\u201d Kade new he would only make it home with a few minutes of sunlight to spare, if this kid lived farther out, there was no he could make it home in time. \u201cBetter safe than sorry.\u201d Kade told him, \u201cBy the way, what\u2019s your name?\u201d \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cTom.\u201d the kid replied. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cNice to meet you, Tom.\u201d Kade said as they crossed another snow covered street. \nTom and Kade passed a few more blocks making small talk about their lives. Tom\u2019s parents were traveling chefs and often away for work. Kade mentioned that his mother would be gone for work tonight as well, but that he could make them both supper. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEventually they reached Kade\u2019s house. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a house key and began unlocking the door. \u201cAre you sure its ok if I come in?\u201d  Tom said hesitantly. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Kade replied \u201cMother would want someone to help me if I needed it. Especially so close to sundown.\u201d\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs a matter of fact, the sun had already set. Looking out the windows of the house, he could see the last few people scurry into their houses. Now, the streets would be silent, except for the barking of the hunters\u2019 dogs. Kade took their jackets and hung them on the coat rack. As he hung Tom\u2019s he noticed a large cut along the side. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d he asked. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cIs it that noticeable?\u201d Tom asked \u201cI tried climbing a tree at the park, when I fell out a branch caught my coat and ripped it open. I was hoping my mom wouldn\u2019t notice. Kade shrugged, \u201cI guess it\u2019s not too bad.\u201d If Kade had another coat he would\u2019ve surely lent it to him. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nKade moved to the kitchen, turning on the oven and getting supper started. He could hear the barking of the hunters\u2019 dogs getting louder. \u201cThat\u2019s odd\u201d Kade started \u201cthe hunters don\u2019t usually come out this way.\u201d He looked to Tom and could see the fear in the young boys glistening green eyes. Tom turned and moved to look out one of the windows. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe out there, not with the hunters anyways.\u201d Tom said. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cThe hunters sure, but the wendigo, that\u2019s the real threat.\u201d Kade replied. \n\n\n\u201cTrue enough, at least that\u2019s what the adults tell us.\u201d Tom said \u201cSometimes I\u2019m not even sure if the stories are true.\u201d\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cOf course, the stories are true, just a few days ago a young boy went missing! You can\u2019t honestly think that\u2019s all made up just to scare us kids.\u201d \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cOk, Ok, maybe they are true.\u201d Tom replied, but did anyone even know who the boy was?\u201d\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nKade thought back to the news article his mom had read. \u201cYoung boy, maybe a year or two younger than me, probably your age actually.\u201d Kade racked his brain for a few moments, what was the kids name? \u201cHere, let\u2019s look at the newspaper article.\u201d Kade said grabbing the newspaper off the table. He opened the wide pages looking for the story. \u201cOk here we go.\u201d He said as he started reading the story out loud. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nLate Monday night the Johnson family received the devastating news that their son had gone missing. Many assume this to the work of a wendigo wandering through the area. Their son was last seen near Maple Park on the south side of town.\n&amp;nbsp;\nKade had forgotten that the park was so close to his own house, that explained why the barking dogs were so close, he continued. \u201cDue to this tragic event, curfew will be enforced at sundown until the Wendigo is found. Thoughts and prayers to the Johnson family and their son Tom in this tragic time.\u201d \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nKade starred coldly at the name, a shiver running down his spine. He slowly lowered the newspaper to the counter to find Tom staring at him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to be the missing Tom, would you.\u201d Kade said, fear creeping into his voice. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTom replied in an unnaturally low voice, \u201cVery good.\u201d As a wicked smile drew across his face.", "ups": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84}, {"genre": "Speculative Fiction", "title": "&lt;Bloodwrath&gt; Chapter 4: Regroup!", "text": "The infirmary was permeated with the disgusting odor of expiring flesh. The door was left open in a vain attempt at some ventilation, and groaning could be heard across the entire west wing of the Castle as a result. I desperately attempt to save who I can. My family's name is Lazarus, and it is my duty to protect the coven. I drape bandages over my hands which had been submerged in healing liquid for the past hour. It wraps around the young Vampire\u2019s stomach \u2014 coaxing one of the silver bullets to the surface.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 uh\u2026 ahh\u2026 AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\u201d He screamed instinctively, causing the room to shake.\n\n\u201cCalm down boy, I know it hurts.\u201d I say with reassurance as I try to maintain my bedside manner. \u201cThis is the last one, then you will be *fine*.\u201d\n\nHis black blood oozed from the wound and congealed as it left his body. Our blood was not like human blood, and anyone unaware of our physiology would think I was extracting some kind of tar pudding from him.\n\nI assuaged the final bullet out, catching it in the cloth. I dropped it into a tin nearby, and it fell with a satisfying clink.\n\n\u201cThere, all better?\u201d I said warmly to the poor suffering boy.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you madam.\u201d He managed a smile through the pain. I appreciated his efforts, and rested a hand on his shoulder.\n\nI stood up, allowing one of my attendants to deal with his recuperation. I wiped some of the blood onto my apron and went to the washing station.\n\nAll of my emotions came forth at once. A potent mixture of sadness, despair and confusion flooded my mind. I have been a nurse for almost two hundred years, and I have never seen an attack on my people from outsiders with this severity. From other Vampires? Of course. The constant struggle for supremacy in our hierarchal system was a given. The dead bodies from warring covens in the Tudor wars numbered in the tens of thousands.\n\nThe silver bullets, religious incantations, and ceremonial burnings however? These were new. Never had human beings been very successful in murdering Vampires. There had been a few cases throughout history, but these were extraordinarily rare.

I wouldn\u2019t believe it if they didn\u2019t call this fancy meeting.\n\n\u201cSuch timing.\u201d I whispered, attempting to cover my mouth with my hand. \u201cWe were on the brink of something great.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell. Maybe we can see this as an opportunity to get closer\u2026\u201d Micah looked around quickly \u201cTo the others. See where there loyalties lie.\u201d\n\nEver the optimist. I smiled inwardly as I pressed on. He was right, of course, we could turn this situation to our advantage, no matter how dire.\n\nI turned the next corner without looking forward and felt myself immediately propelled backwards. I caught myself before I fell, bracing with the crumbling sidewall. I looked up to see what caused it.\n\n\u201cWren scum.\u201d A rotund laughter shook the already crumbling walls around us.\n\nSam Tilian stood in front of me, flushed as ever. He was flanked by one of his companions from before, but this time their demeanor wasn\u2019t so inviting.\n\n\u201cSam, I see you didn\u2019t leave any food for the others.\u201d The corners of my mouth turned upwards in a wicked smile.\n\n\u201cAlways were the funny one, ay, Rathiel?\u201d This time he wasn\u2019t laughing.\n\nI turned my head to my right \u2014\n\nA claw caught the side of my face.\n\n\u201cSIT. DOWN.\u201d Came a blood curdling scream. His taller companion who was reserved in the dining hall showed no signs of pacifism now. He hit me like the hilt of a two handed blade, straight in the right side of my cheek.\n\nI fell to the ground in a daze, nothing escaping my mouth except a decompressing groan. In the next second, they were on me.\n\nI braced myself for impact, my forearms crossed above my eyes.\n\nThen, in an instant \u2014 he was on them.\n\nI saw the plume of smoke appear behind their shoulders, Micah must have noticed the commotion ahead and waited, drawing them in, using me as bait. I couldn\u2019t help but be impressed.\n\nHe let out a guttural roar as he placed one hand on each of their heads. Their eyes widened as their senses caught his presence, too late.\n\nHe slammed them both to the ground. Seizing the opportunity, I rushed to my feet. I stood at his side, claws raised. There were no weapons permitted in the castle, save the Royal Guard. But our family was one of dirt and mud, proficient in brawling out of necessity. Our fangs protruded with our mouths agape, and we let out a simultaneous *hisssss* that signaled our combat readiness.\n\nThey returned the stance, save their backs being slightly arched, resulting in a much lower center of gravity.\n\nMicah charged first. He locked arms with the taller one, grappling fiercely. I closed the gap and threw a right hook at Sam, glancing him on the side of his face. Before he could recover, I raised my boot and delivered a kick to his chest, submerging him in a column that decorated the hallway.\n\nI turned immediately and saw my brother pinned. In a swift step, I was behind him, arms locked under the taller man\u2019s armpits, holding him up. Micah took the lead and delivered blow after blow on his chest, as he screamed out in pain. Micah\u2019s muscles pumped with adrenaline, his veins bursting through his forearms. After a minute of punishment, the Tilian started to slump \u2014 I noticed the flash of Micah\u2019s emerald encrusted brass knuckles on his hands.\n\nI smiled. Nothing needed to be said. Sam was still slumped on the pillar, and his companion was a crumpled mess on the ground. We wiped our hands of it, dragging their scotch imbued bodies to the side of the hallway where they wouldn\u2019t disturb anyone.\n\nWe make our way down the hall with renewed vigor. A scrap with some of the young bloods was always good for the confidence.\n\n\u201cTut. Tut.\u201d A familiar voice confronted us.\n\n\u201cLayla..\u201d\n\nShe held a gloved hand up to my lips.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell if you won\u2019t, boys.\u201d She winked, her blue eyes sparkled beneath her crimson hood. She had the most wry, all-knowing smile. It was best to just drop the subject.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d She kept walking, beckoning us forward. \u201cMy birds told me you had a meeting with the King?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always have an inkling of everything, don\u2019t you night owl.\u201d I said in a tone that dripped with annoyance. \u201cYes, we met with the King. Yes it is confidential. No I won\u2019t speak about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny. My Birds also tell me about a wounded clan burdening the infirmary.

We will establish outposts, and NASA will develop automated cargo ships to transport commodities to the remote regions in which we have ventured.\n\nOne such automated cargo ship, Hostess One, was deployed in connection with a NASA/Hostess partnership and was in charge of bringing junk food to astronaut outposts. Twinkies, Hohos, Snowballs, Ding dongs, Fruit Pies, Donettes, and a variety of other Hostess delicacies would make the astronauts feel more at ease.\n\nHostess One, on the other hand, was hit by an electromagnetic field on its first mission, and its computer was fried. The incident propelled the autonomous cargo ship into space, eventually landing on a goldilocks planet in the Proxima Centauri system.\n\nWhile the astronauts at the outpost were disappointed, NASA did not believe it was worthwhile to pursue Hostess One.\n\nEarth colonization finally reached the Proxima Centauri system 500 years later. Of course, the goldilocks planet where Hostess One had landed was one of the first objectives for Earth colonists.\n\nAs it turns out, the arrival of Hostess One was a watershed moment for the planet's most intelligent species. The vacuum-sealed dessert sweets nourished the species early in its evolution on what the inhabitants call Planet Twinkie, their favorite snack delight.\n\nThey were able to duplicate the junk food they tasted from Hostess One and thrive without consuming vegetables, protein, or any nutrition whatsoever. They developed advanced technology, large-scale military forces, and religious shrines dedicated to some of Hostess' most famous snack treats. There was Ding Dong Temple, Honey Bun Synagogue, and Zinger Cathedral, where Suzy Q, the high priest, performed all religious rites.\n\nAs soon as the Earth astronauts arrived, they realized that the planet's overweight intelligent species may be a valuable ally, as their technology and military capabilities could improve life on Earth.\n\nAs a gesture of goodwill, the Earth astronauts served them some new junk food that was not available on Hostess One.\n\n\"This is a muffin, but only the top,\" the astronaut explains.\n\n\"But wait a minute, that's the best part of the muffin!\" The alien says.\n\n\"That's why we did it,\" the astronaut explains. \"It's called a muffin top.\"\n\n\"Do you have anything else?\" The alien asks.\n\n\"We have a cereal made entirely of chocolate chip cookies; we have a breakfast egg sandwich with maple-flavored pancakes for tops; we deep-fry those Twinkies you love so much; in fact, you can deep fry anything,\" the astronaut says.\n\n\"What is deep-fry?\" The alien asks.\n\n\"Be prepared for your mind to be blown!\" The astronaut says.\n\nThe humans then proceed to demonstrate to the aliens how to take their favorite munchies, dip them in a mixture of flour, butter, and eggs, then deep fry them in oil.\n\nThe first time the alien took a bite of the fried twinkie, their eyes lit up like a baby having sugar for the first time.\n\nThe humans hooked the aliens, resulting in a beneficial trade partnership between Earth and Planet Twinkie. Even though Earth had forbidden most junk food in 2084, humanity would send the aliens whatever they had left of the previous century's sugary concoctions. Such as all 50 flavors of mega stuff Oreos, chicken sandwiches on donut buns, and the aliens' new favorite indulgence, a snack food turducken, a twinkie inside a donut stick, deep-fried, and dusted with powdered sugar.\n\nHowever, after roughly a decade, humans were able to replicate most of the alien technology and began to withdraw from some of their trade agreements with the Twinkie Planet.\n\nThe gluttonous aliens were enraged by the lack of snack food alternatives, so they assembled their vast armies and prepared to attack Earth. The first Twinkie Space War lasted two years. There were many casualties, and the war ended in a draw. The humans agreed to resume 60% of the snack trade but were adamant about withholding Cinnabuns due to the 2142 cinnamon shortage.\n\nAs cargo ships arrived, the aliens saw that the container was only half full. Twinkie Space War One had ravaged the frosting industry since they had halted manufacturing in order to construct laser-guided phaser guns. The aliens had enough of the human excuses and wrote them a stern letter. Unfortunately, the alien general who penned the letter got grease on it, and the humans mistook \"cheesecake\" for \"human death.\"\n\nThe second Twinkie Space War began as a result of the misunderstanding. This time around, the war lasted nearly five years and only ended when the humans dropped a chocolate volcano on the aliens.\n\nThere were also proxy wars. Who could forget the Zebra Cakes debacle in the Andromeda Galaxy, the Devil Dogs engagement in Centaurus A, and the Entenmann's assassination on the planet of Thelonious in Messier 87?\n\nFollowing Twinkie Space War Two, anti-snack food sentiments began to spread throughout the universe. The message was one of peace, love, and harmony. The dessert cake industrial complex still had an agenda, but it wasn't until they discovered a long-forbidden drink deep inside their archives that they realized they had a game-changer. It was called Coca-Cola, and it had been illegal for nearly a century; it was the key to reigniting the snack cake wars.\n\nAs the humans arrived at Planet Twinkie with Coca-Cola in hand, ready to attack. They learned that the entire Twinkie Planet suffered a heart attack and became extinct. That day, all of the KitKats were cut in half in honor of their long-time nemesis.", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "&lt;Bloodwrath&gt; Chapter 2: Planning", "text": "The doors opened with a groan as I pushed on them with the lightest touch.

Ultimately though, the best solution would\u2019ve been to abstain from having met her in the first place.\n\nThis was a thing that happened to the people he loved, this was a thing that happened to the people he cared about. \n\nA sexually-transmitted disease that only he seemed to carry, ever since his first, with the unusual and horrible effect of slowly and agonizingly turning his lovers into paint. \n\nHe thought Margaret might\u2019ve been the one to resist it, somehow, she\u2019d gone five whole months without showing any signs.

Her only expression at the moment came in a series of faint gurgling sounds that only he could understand; they meant that she was in pain.\n\nThe symptoms had started with mild jittering, which progressed to memory loss, giving way to lost time, fevers, abrasions and cuts without cause, and frequent facial spasms. Eventually, it all resulted in the second-to-final stage, nigh-total paralysis. After that, the only thing left was the actual transformation itself\n\nDoctor Valtz knocked on the door and Allen could hear the sounds of three other footsteps tromping-up.

How about the screaming, how do you explain that? To which he replied with highly unlikely and clearly hastily strung-together answers.

They failed to search the roof.\n\nAfter the cops had begrudgingly left, clearly dissatisfied with the information he\u2019d provided them, but tired and lacking anything concrete with which to bust him, he wept for hours over the painting. Smudging the picture where Margaret had once stood.

About half of the land on either side was used for farming where corn, soybeans, and the occasional patch of tobacco grew. The rest of it, where a house didn\u2019t sit, was wooded. Most of the homes were small, single-story ranch-style houses with a few trailers peppered here and there. Some of the yards were well kept but most were full of junk cars and American flags.\n\nThese were the boonies where everyone minded their own business and anyone who broke that one simple rule ended up on the wrong end of a shotgun. Whether or not a blast of fire and steel came from the mouth of said shotgun all depended on what kind of day its owner was having, good mood or bad. Flannel shirts and camouflage had been the fashion trend here since hunters started wearing camo. Before then it was just flannel and overalls, and everyone owned a pair of steel-toed boots.\n\nThe sky was turning from blue to various shades of red, orange, and pink when Sherry and Helga pulled into the long, gravel driveway off Springdale Road. In the back, encompassed by tall oaks and cedars, was the farmhouse and it looked ominous in the dark shade of the trees. All one hundred and seventeen acres of land that surrounded the farmhouse had grown up with weeds, small trees, and tall grass in the last fifty years or so. No one had farmed it since Papaw left Grandma and now it was a safe haven for all the good-eatin\u2019 critters to hide from the redneck army that waited for them in the trees.\n\nWith little idea of what they were looking for, Sherry and Helga parked in front of the old porch that led up to the red front door and was starting to show its signs of age. Not quite rotting but not in the best shape either. A fresh coat of paint would mask most of its issues after scraping away what was flaking off. All the paint around the two-story, white house was peeling. Boxy and devoid of fancy architecture, this is where it all began for Sherry and Helga, home-sweet-home.\n\nA loud creaking moan announced their arrival and the red door swung open like it sat on a pair of freshly greased hinges. Old is the best way to describe the smell on the inside but to Sherry and Helga, it was the smell of their childhood. It no longer reeked of Grandma\u2019s cigarettes, nasty old Pall Malls, but the yellow nicotine still stained the ceilings. The walls were the same yellow-tinged white but everything else was brown hardwood. All the floors, trim, and the staircase. \n\nLoud creaks filled the house with each noisy step up the stairs towards Grandma\u2019s old room. Neither Sherry nor Helga said a word to the other. They knew where they were going, they just didn\u2019t know what they would find, if anything. In truth, they didn\u2019t expect to find anything. Just old trinkets and neatly folded clothes that had not been worn in years which, surprisingly, had not been touched by the mice.\n\nSherry opened the double set of closet doors and started rummaging through the hanging jackets and shoe boxes while Helga raided the long dresser compete with a vanity mirror. For about twenty minutes they dug and snooped, turning up nothing but some old postcards and a gold ring Grandma thought she lost in her last days of declining health. \n\nHelga let out a huff of wind and sat on the bed beckoning Sherry to do the same. It was the first time the sheets had been wrinkled in at least ten years. Since before the home was left unoccupied, no one ever went into Grandma\u2019s room. There had been no need to until now. \u201cWhat if we don\u2019t find anything useful?\u201d Helga asked Sherry. Sherry turned her attention towards the bed and gave Helga a curious look. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you looked under the bed yet?\u201d Sherry said.\n\n\u201cNo, Grandma never kept anything under there. She always said to never keep anything valuable under your bed. It\u2019s the first place someone looks when they want to find something.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of good that saying was,\u201d Sherry laughed. \u201cEither that or we\u2019re just stupid. Neither of us thought to check.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just told you that Grandma never kept anything under there.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr maybe that\u2019s what she wanted you to think.\u201d Sherry got down on her knees and peeked her head under the wood frame. Nothing. Helga was right. Not wanting to leave any stone unturned, Sherry turned her head back and forth, scanning the emptiness. Still nothing. Nothing but an out of place looking piece of flooring with a hole in it just big enough to put a finger through, which Sherry did. \u201cHelga!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? There\u2019s nothing under there. I already told you.\u201d Helga sounded a little bit annoyed. Being the older sibling, Helga had often been annoyed at her little sister\u2019s refusal to listen to her. Like when they were little girls and she told Sherry not to go swimming in the old pond about half of a mile from the back of the house and Sherry decided she was going to do it anyways. Sherry ended up screaming for her dear life when she found a copperhead sharing the cool water with her and thrashed her way back to the shore with tears streaming from her eyes. That was Sherry, stubborn and adventurous up until it was time for big sister to save the day and pull her from the pond before that mean-old-snake could sink its fangs into her little toes.\n\n\u201cNo, come look at this! I think I found something.\u201d\n\nStill annoyed but not wanting to argue, Helga knelt beside the bed and looked under. Sherry had pulled the board up from the floor, which was loose and easy to do. \u201cMove the bed,\u201d Sherry said after feeling around under the floor with her hand. \u201cI think there\u2019s something in here.\u201d Both of them pushed the bed to the side, which made an obnoxious fart sound as it moved across the floor. Reaching her hand back under the floor, Sherry pulled out a small, wooden box with a red pentagram engraved on the lid.\n\n\u201cGrandma wasn\u2019t into witchcraft, was she?\u201d Sherry asked Helga.\n\n\u201cNo, she would have told me if she was.\u201d\n\nSherry and Helga exchanged worried glances before Sherry unlatched the golden clasp and looked inside.

Instead of staying on campus, I decided to pack a bag and drive home for a few months. I didn\u2019t want to pass up an opportunity for free rent and groceries. Plus, I wanted to see my high school friends again. After a month of doing the same thing every weekend, we were desperate for new ideas. Being the paranormal nerd that I am, I saw this as a chance to suggest a ghost hunting night out. Surprisingly, everyone was on board. The next question was, where should we go?\n\nAfter some quick Google searches, I found a forum that talked about a \u201chaunted\u201d park that was only 20 minutes away from us. Since the park closed at 10 PM and was regularly patrolled by cops, the forum suggested that night-time visitors should park in the nearby neighborhoods and walk to park entrance, to avoid being noticed. Easy enough we thought. We packed our flashlights and headed out to the park around 10 PM. In the car, I told them all about the history of the park and reported hauntings.\n\n*According to the forum thread, an axe murderer used to wander the woods at night, killing any unsuspecting night-time visitors. Although only 3 bodies were discovered, the actual number of victims who had fallen prey to his axe is still unknown to this day. Since then, it has been rumored that if you go to the park and walk the paths during a full moon between the times of 9:30 PM and midnight, mysterious balls of lights can be seen dancing around the woods. Some say you are left mesmerized by the dancing lights and unconsciously driven deeper into the woods. The further you go, the lights disappear and are replaced by insidious laughter and moaning screams. If you are really quiet and still, footsteps in the woods can be heard. The longer you remain standing, the closer the footsteps sound and are soon accompanied by heavy breathing. And if you are brave enough to wait until the footsteps are inches away, a feeling of dread and evil will wash over your body like a wave of thick fog before everything goes completely silent.*\n\n*People may go as far to say that these woods are cursed. Similar to the Japan\u2019s Aokigahara forest, these woods have also driven hopeless souls to their end. For the finale, if you stand on one of the seven bridges, whispers of an apparition formed by the traveling mist above the water will develop in front of you. But no one has stuck around long enough to know what would happen next\u2026*\n\nBefore we even parked our car, everyone was already creeped out. As suggested by the forum, we parked in the neighborhoods and walked to the entrance. Luckily, the streetlamps did a good job illuminating the way, but they stopped before we reached the park\u2019s entrance, leaving us in complete darkness. The first thing we did was cross a bridge into the woods. No one wanted to risk seeing an apparition quite yet, so we didn\u2019t stand still for very long. I can\u2019t remember if the moon was full, but we didn\u2019t see any lights dancing around the woods as we walked down the paths. The more I think about it, I actually think there was no moon that night, because it was pitch dark. I remember laughing about how we couldn\u2019t have picked a darker night. After about 30 minutes of walking through the woods with no sightings, we exited onto a beach that bordered Lake Michigan. It was a beautiful, warm night so we hung out on the beach for about an hour, gossiping, laughing, and telling ghost stories while we threw rocks into the water.\n\nEventually, we decided to walk back to the car. On the way back through the woods, I distanced myself from everyone to see if I could catch something on my camera. I stood still on the path as my friends walked ahead of me. When they were far enough to where I couldn\u2019t hear them talking, I decided to start walking again. But right before I left, I turned around to take one last picture of the path we were leaving behind\u2026\n\nAs soon as the flash went off, I heard a child giggle from the thicket of trees right next to me and I heard fast paced footsteps heading my way. My heart sunk to my stomach and I immediately had this feeling of dread take over my entire body. Within seconds, my fight or flight instincts kicked in and I took off running at top speed. It didn\u2019t take long for me to catch up with my friends, but I didn\u2019t stop there. I knocked over one of my friends and I kept running until the sickening sensation wore off. I stopped and turned around to see my friends running up behind me as well. I reached out to the one I knocked over to apologize and I felt her entire body shivering. *Why didn\u2019t you say something?!* Was the first thing she said to me. *Let\u2019s continue walking. I want to leave.*\n\nI apologized as we quickly walked back to the car and I told them what happened to me. Apparently, something similar happened to them too.

I\u2019ve been seeing it in my dreams. It\u2019s a shadow but like a man. A shadow man,\u201d Sherry said. Helga\u2019s face became grim, like all the joy had been sucked out of her, and she nearly ran off the road but pulled herself together at the last moment. \u201cWhat the hell, Helga?\u201d Sherry yelled as she grabbed the oh-shit handle. \u201cI just survived one wreck. Don\u2019t put me through another one.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom used to talk about a shadow man before she died.\u201d Helga\u2019s voice was serious and her face pale with fear. \u201cGrandma too. She said it was a generational curse passed down from mother to daughter. I always thought it would be me that it comes for since I\u2019m the oldest. They did too. That\u2019s why we never told you.\u201d\n\nSherry\u2019s mouth hung open for a few moments before she was able to talk. She couldn\u2019t believe what her sister was telling her. Helga had known about what she was going through this whole time and had kept it to herself. Part of Sherry felt betrayed by her sister, part of her wanted to understand why it had been kept from her. \u201cWhy did you never say anything to me? I\u2019ve been having these nightmares, and everything\u2019s been so horrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you have believed me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sherry answered after thinking for a few moments. \u201cI thought this was all because of Bradley. When he left, that\u2019s when the nightmares started.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it was for mom too. Remember how she fell apart when dad left her? Same with grandma. Once Papaw left it was all downhill for her.\u201d Helga put on her turn signal and merged left to pass a slow-moving line of semi-trucks. \u201cMom thought dad leaving had something to do with the shadow. Like it was manipulating its way into her life. Then, everything got better again. The shadow went away.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust went away? That makes no sense. Why would it just go away like that?\u201d\n\nHelga looked over at Sherry and locked eyes with her before turning her attention back to the road. \u201cIt found a suitable replacement. A sacrifice in her place.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom\u2019s accident,\u201d said Sherry. \u201cI remember now. She nearly drowned in the lake when her boat tipped over. Then that kind man jumped in to save her and\u2026\u201d Sherry\u2019s eyes grew wide, and she gasped loudly. Helga looked over at Sherry again and nodded.\n\n\u201cHe drowned in her place. It\u2019s over, Sherry. The shadow\u2019s been appeased. You don\u2019t have to be scared anymore. The curse if over for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. No!\u201d Sherry said nearly screaming as Helga turned off the interstate back towards town. They were nearing Sherry\u2019s house, but Sherry didn\u2019t want to go home anymore. \u201cTake me to the farmhouse.\u201d The farmhouse is where she and Helga grew up at just outside of town on an old country back road. Springdale Road. It had been passed down from generation to generation in their family and now they shared it but neither lived in it. Mostly, they just used it for storage, visiting it for nostalgia\u2019s sake once in a blue moon.\n\n\u201cWhy the farmhouse?\u201d Helga asked being clearly confused at this new request.\n\n\u201cYou said Mom and Grandma both dealt with this thing too. Maybe there\u2019s something in their old belongings that might give us some clues about it.\u201d\n\nHelga nearly laughed at this but held it back. \u201cSherry,\u201d she said smiling. \u201cWhy would you want to go looking for that? I already told you, it\u2019s over. You\u2019re done with this thing. It\u2019s not coming for you anymore.\u201d\n\nOffended at this statement, Sherry snapped back at Helga saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not about me! That firefighter went missing because of that thing. What if he\u2019s still alive? Wouldn\u2019t you like to end this curse once and for all?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone, Sherry. He took your place. Just like with mom and just like with grandma. Besides you don\u2019t have a daughter. What\u2019s there to worry about?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if it\u2019s your daughter next?\u201d Helga looked at Sherry disgusted that she would ever say such a thing. \u201cYou said it was a family thing. If I don\u2019t have a daughter, then why wouldn\u2019t it be yours? We have to do this. It\u2019s not right that that firefighter\u2019s gone because of me. Because of that thing.\u201d\n\nWith a loud sigh, Helga shook her head again and agreed with Sherry. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said then turned the car around going towards the old country road, Springdale Road, where the farmhouse is. \u201cBut I\u2019m doing this for my daughter.\u201d\n\nSherry smiled and took Helga\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this for me.\u201d", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "The Pack", "text": " \n\nHe stopped suddenly. Did he hear that? Something behind him. He whirled and saw...nothing. The tree line he had come from was shrouded in darkness. He looked up towards the moon, huge and filling the night sky. He could plainly see the Milky Way, a river of heavily creamed coffee. The expanse, It made you feel small, cold, insignificant. At the same time it was the kind of beauty that could make you cry, maybe after a drink or two. He looked around him. Nothing but frozen tundra. Clumps of dead-looking vegetation here and there, rocks and a few suspicious looking rocky outcroppings all beautifully lit with the cold glow of Earth's celestial neighbor.  He looked forward. He was in a wide clearing and could see the next tree line two hundred yards in front of him. He knew from there it was only another hundred yards at most to outpost 118. Just three hundred or so yards to safety. Once more he started running. \n\nHis lungs burned, his thighs felt as though they were exploding with every stride and every heartbeat brought with it blinding white-hot pain thudding in his temples. Still, he kept running. His body was screaming out, begging him to stop. A rogue part of his mind conspired against him. Convincing him that he could stop,  just for a moment. Just a few seconds to catch his breath. To rest his aching calves and let the deep stitch in his side subside. Besides he was never going to make it anyway. Why spend his last few moments running like a coward? Realizing weakness and doubt were worming their way into his brain, he shoved the thoughts away and shook his head. Gathering his strength with an audible grunt of effort he picked up the pace. \n\nHis mind was his own enemy. He felt wild with fear, unable to stop his runaway thoughts. Thinking back to when he\u2019d first arrived out here. Excited to start the project, hopeful towards the future. Then everything was torn apart like so much tissue paper. Images of his co-workers, friends, flashing in his mind's eye. He thought of his first meeting with the Director, Miranda Gales. A tall Nordic-looking woman with long wavy platinum blonde hair and sharp angular features that belied her warm friendly disposition. In another life he would have asked her to dinner. He had always admired people with passion and Miranda had that in spades. A passion for her research, for the work, but more importantly she had the kind of enthusiasm for life that he so wished he could find. Maybe that's why he had felt so strongly about her so easily. Unfortunately she wasn\u2019t much more than a pile of guts and bone on the floor of the research lab now. \n\nHe retched, his stomach rolling at the images now flooding his mind.  He tripped over a larger rock. Falling face first into the deep snow, which shocked the breath right out of his lungs. He lay there seeing Talbot's head, missing the bottom jaw. He saw Naomi\u2019s foot, at least he thought it was her foot going by the bright pink nail polish, looking like a sock with spaghetti spilling out. Suddenly his senses were assaulted. Reliving the moments of the past days. Smelling the metallic hard stench of blood and shit. Hearing the screaming wails of his fellow human beings. He didn\u2019t know which was worse. The screaming that went on and on? Or the screams seemingly cut like turning off a radio or television. He managed to push himself to his knees just before his stomach contents, of which there was little to begin with, expelled themselves. After this happened a few times he was finally able to sit up, rocking back on his haunches. \n\nHe sat like this for a moment. Eyes shut tight, breathing deeply, in through the mouth, out through the nose. He pushed away the thoughts of gore and opened his eyes. Focusing on the tree line, now less than one hundred yards in front of him he stood slowly. He took a few more deep breaths. Holding the last one in for a moment before looking at the sky. \u201cI. Will. Make. it.\u201d He said between breaths. With that he started running once more. It was at that moment he heard it. A sound so cold and full of malice. It seemed that sound that could freeze the very sun.

She looked out and could see the leaves falling from the few trees that still bore them. The driver finished admiring the beauty of the colors all around her and finally opened the door, stepping out into the cool November air. The driver gathered her things, applying her mask and swinging her backpack onto her shoulder as the car door slammed shut. She was sure she had everything keys, wallet, phone. Yes, it was all there. She made her way out of the parking lot and out onto the sidewalk where others were walking quickly both ways. Everyone was in a hurry to their destinations, and no one noticed the driver as she walked up to the main crosswalk. The signal beeped several short, sharp, distinct beeps as it warned of the coming no walk signal. Without a second thought, the driver quickly hurried across the sidewalk, blocking a vehicle as their light turned green and they moved to turn left, directly into the driver. Without a second thought she stepped up onto the curb and the car drove behind and past her, heading to their destination. \n\nOur driver made her way into the building, slipping past several others who were standing in the middle of the hallway, oblivious to the obstacle they were creating. She turned past them and hurried down a different hallway and through a brown door. As she pushed open the door another person was walking out at the same time. The driver jumped in startlement and quickly apologized for almost smacking the other person in the face with the door. \u201cWhy are bathroom doors always push to enter and pull to leave?\u201d she thought as the other girl walked out, excusing the driver from the near-fatal door accident. \u201cIt makes so much more sense to have the pull to enter and push to leave. No one wants to touch a door handle after washing their hands. IF they even washed their hands.\u201d Her face crumpled in disgust as that thought entered her mind. The look remained as she entered the stall, removing her backpack and setting everything down in the corner while she peed. While in the stall others entered, their conversations loud and distracting, and very unnecessary in the small room where everyone could hear. \u201cYeah,\u201d said a voice from a stall or two over. \u201cI told her not to sleep with that guy, he is known as a player and only wants to get his dick sucked and bounce. But you know Ashley, always has to have what she wants.\u201d Laughter from the stall next to the driver echoed in the bathroom as the friend of the original speaker replied to what had been said. \u201cThat is so trashy, she could do so much better.\u201d Flushes were heard as the girls exited their stalls, their conversation continuing as they exited WITHOUT washing their hands. \u201cTypical,\u201d thought the driver as she flushed and exited the stall, washing her hands before picking up her items and preparing to leave the restroom. Of course, she grabbed a paper towel and used it to open the door, the number of germs on that thing had to be insanely high. \n\nWith only a few moments to spare she hurried down the original hallway and slipped into the large auditorium classroom. She made her way to her usual seat and frowned slightly when she saw someone else sitting where she normally did. For a moment the thought entered her head to just sit on the same row a few chairs away from him, but no, she would just sit in one of the side rows, by herself. As she sat the professor began his lecture, quickly writing out the notes as he spoke, his pace fast and hurried with no regard for the students before him who was writing as fast as possible to keep up. The driver pulled out her phone, hitting record on it before setting it down next to her to record the lecture. Once that was completed, she pulled out her laptop and began keeping track of the notes, occasionally becoming distracted by emails and random thoughts. Once the professor was sure that he had completely bored the class to near-death he concluded his speech and announced that everyone could leave. The driver, satisfied, gathered her possessions and made her way out of the room. \n\nDespite her class all leaving at the same time, the halls were still empty since most of the students had escaped up the stairs or through the doors outside. She quickly followed the few still there outside, back into the crisp air, squinting into the sunlight for a few moments before pulling her sunglasses down from off her head. She had eaten before she left home but had brought a frozen meal to eat for lunch. This meal was sitting on the passenger seat of her car, thawing slowly from its frozen state. Even though she was not particularly hungry, she knew she would not have time later to eat and made her way back towards her car. On her way, she realized she had forgotten her half-drunk energy drink in the car before class. Excitement filled her as she thought of finishing the delicious energy tea drink. \u201cIt should still even be cold,\u201d she thought to herself, setting her bag down to retrieve her keys. After a moment or two struggle to unlock the door, she was in, grabbing the still partially frozen meal and setting it inside her bag. She feverishly stood up, moving her hand to grab the drink from the holder in the middle, stopping in terror and fear. There was nothing there. The drink was not in the place where she would have left it. She blinked several times, looking around at other parts of the car, desperately searching for the can of energy that would help her to fuel her day. \u201cBut it must be here\u2026\u201d she mumbled out loud, stepping back to take a good, hard look at the interior and then the exterior of the vehicle. Where could she have left it? In her mind, she pictured her earlier walk to class, the side trip of the bathroom, the seat she had sat at in class, and then the trip back to the car. There was no place where she could remember having it, no trace of the location of the drink.

He had to get her somewhere safe, if such a place existed anymore.\n\nOne foot after the other, Fenton left the smoldering suburbs, gunshots ringing staccato punctuations in the otherwise eerie silence. Terrified, he could hear his heart beating fast. He turned left off the densely populated road as soon as he could, but knew that taking Walnut Street to Harveston Highway would add miles to his desperate trek.\n\n\u201cAnd miles to go before I sleep,\u201d he said in a whisper to himself. Everyone had told Fenton his Master\u2019s Degree in Poetry was a joke, and he suddenly recalled that his undergrad university had offered a Crisis Management major. Where were those people?\n\nWithout any way to defend himself, whenever he caught a glimpse of or heard someone, he hid until they passed by. Suppressing a shiver on the unseasonably cold spring day, he obscured himself from view behind the cheerily painted yellow garden shed in the side yard of an abandoned house. A group of thugs strutted down the street, eight strong, armed, and boldly having a loud conversation. Fenton didn\u2019t care to know about what, merely listening until the sounds of their menacing voices faded into the distance.\n\nHe decided that even if he\u2019d had a gun, it might have just made him braver than he should have been. He had no experience with guns.\n\nIn time, it wouldn\u2019t matter. All the technology on Earth was having to be rebuilt. The solar flare had taken out everything from transformers to computers. Hardly any factories had rallied enough to manufacture, yet. Sometime, the bullets would run out, he reasoned.\n\nIt continued this way for fifteen more miles until he hit farmland. Fenton wasn\u2019t sure how much further he could walk. His legs felt like they were both numb and burning at the same time.\n\nReluctantly, he found a place in the woods by the road and lay down on the hard, cold ground to sleep in the fading light.\n\nThe next day, he was so sore he found it hard to get up. Not only were his legs sore, but his back was screaming about the night on the uneven ground in the cold weather. He stretched and stretched every way he\u2019d ever been shown while running track for four months in eighth grade. Fenton was already thirsty, but nothing could be done.\n\nHe had to continue. His fiance might be in danger, or as more time elapsed she might have to leave the farm where she lived with her aunt. He\u2019d never find her, then.\n\nAs he walked, his muscles loosened and stopped complaining as much. He worried a bit that his legs felt like they were giving off heat, but kept going as fast as he could.\n\nIn the late afternoon he staggered into the yard of the white farmhouse.\n\nHis fiance erupted out of the light blue front door, having been keeping watch at the window upstairs, and ran to him.

Aase and Fenton weeded and watered the vast garden for hours every day, talking.

What do you call those, Cain?\u201d \n\nCain replied apprehensively, \u201cI call them blueberries.\u201d Then sensing his selection was poorly received grabbed a different berry cluster, \u201cAnd these ones I call blackberries.\u201d \n\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Adam groaned while pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cYou\u2019re just not getting it, Cain. Your mother is going to wake up from her nap soon, delighted to see you, but also anxious to find out what you two have brought us. New means of sustenance. New discoveries that could change our lives. But they\u2019ve got to sound sexy, Cain. Otherwise your mother will never go for it. If there\u2019s no mystique, no allure, she\u2019ll never give it a chance. We need something to distract her from her obsession with the forbidden fruit. That horrible, awful, life-changing fruit in that god-forsaken garden with that idiot snake. I was literally the only man on earth and she fooled around on me with a reptile. I swear to god, I\u2019ll never understand women. \n\nThe boys twiddled their thumbs awkwardly during their fathers tirade. Then Abel broke the uncomfortable silence that followed, \u201cWait until you try the Dragonfruit, dad!\u201d \n\n\u201dDid you just say Dragonfruit?\u201d Adam exclaimed. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking bad-ass!\u201d \n\nCain tried his best to put on a happy face but the envy he felt towards his brother was growing faster than the mold on the heart shaped red berries he aptly named heart-shaped red-berries. \n\n\u201cThis is amazing!\u201d Adam mumbled with a mouth full. \u201cDragonfruit! Fucking rad!\u201d \n\nAbel dusted off his shoulders and smirked at his underacheiveing brother. The hatred in Cain\u2019s heart begin to simmer. \n\n\u201cAbel, my boy, you\u2019ve outdone yourself on this one. I\u2019m super proud of you son,\u201d Adam declared. Then with less conviction, he added, \u201cYou too, Cain.\u201d \n\nCain, however, was not ready to throw in the towel, as he still had yet to unleash his secret weapon. \n\n\u201cBehold,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cFor what I\u2019m about to present you is the most delicious thing I\u2019ve ever tasted. I risked my life climbing the highest trees nearly falling to my death in order to locate this delicious treat. I wrestled this bundle away from an aggressive pack of spider monkeys, ducking and dodging vicious blows from their swiftly swinging monkey paws. It was a harrowing journey, Father, but a productive one. For now, I present you with, Curvy-Yellow-Thing!\u201d \n\nSilence ensued with the exception of the chirping sounds the grass made as they had yet to discover crickets. \n\n\u201cYou hate it don\u2019t you,\u201d Cain muttered dejectedly, his head bowed in shame, staring at his feet. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s delicious, Cain,\u201d his father assured him. \u201cYou just don\u2019t have a knack for words like your brother. Help him out will you, Abel?\u201d \n\nAbel scratched his chin for a moment, snapped his fingers and pointed at his crestfallen brother. \u201cBanana!\u201d He smugly shouted  \n\n\u201cSon-of-a-Bitch that\u2019s good,\u201d Adam exclaimed. \u201cHow do you come up with these names so quickly?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just flows right off the top my my head,\u201d Abel replied. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a way with words, that\u2019s for sure. \n\n\u201cThanks, Pop. I\u2019m gonna be a rapper when I grow up.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be the first in line to buy your album.\u201d \n\n\u201cI got bars, Dad.\u201d \n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s right.\u201d \n\nThe hatred in Cain\u2019s heart began to boil. \n\nSo he wasn\u2019t as creative or artistic as his brother. So what? He was stronger, bolder, and far more determined. The focus of his determination was being the favorite child. And today had proven an obstacle difficult to overcome. He wished he were more like his brother. Maybe then his father would show him the same amount of affection he had only observed from the sidelines. But he wasn\u2019t creative or artistic. He couldn\u2019t dream up the wildly inventive names for fruit like his brother. If only he were Abel.\n\nEve was finally awake. Adam instructed the boys to go stand in the pasture a hundred yards away for 7-9 minutes, so he could give his wife a much needed back massage. \n\n\u201cThen you can show her all of your glorious findings!\u201d He proclaimed. \n\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Abel.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cain concurred. \u201cThat will be just fine.\u201d \n\nThe boys both turned and headed towards the field.

He had left school and worked as a cargo tech since the age of 14; in four years, he had worked for three different companies. His job wasn't particularly tasking and the pay was acceptable, yet it wasn't anything to be jealous of, which was why Artie had leapt at the chance of a lucrative job offer from Myers &amp; Co Logistics.\n\nHe had been feeling a little dissatisfied with his recent job working as a cargo tech for a small company in the Port of Angeles, so he had seen a bizarre advert on the HoloVerse for a cargo tech role and had applied to Myers &amp; Co. The salary advertised was more than twice his current wages in the Port of Angeles, yet it required only two years of experience on the ground.\n\nWeeks later, Artie had been shocked when he had been invited to Myers &amp; Co's New York offices and asked to be the first cargo tech to ride aboard MagLev One in the newly built Tower One of the Orbital Towers. The corporation could not risk the use of robots or automation just yet, therefore they required humans to undertake the work on the ground, in transit and also in orbit.\n\nThe first trip, therefore, was to be a PR operation and also a televised live journey aboard MagLev One. Artie would be the only worker onboard and would be paid a CA$20,000 lump-sum bonus on top of a five-year employment contract with Myers &amp; Co with various perks and packages along with an annual salary of CA$77,000 and premium health insurance extending to injury, radiation protection and much more.\n\nArtie had accepted and weeks later, he was on the ground, poised to begin loading the small number of cargo onto MagLev One.\n\nHe had smiled for the cameras and grinning journalists and had responded \"Excited\" when asked how he felt.\n\nThe trip aboard MagLev one, whilst rapid in acceleration, had taken nearly 36 hours; Artie had been awake for 22 hours of that time.\n\nOnce in orbit, he had smiled and waved for the onboard cameras and had begun unloading the little cargo onboard onto a nearby shuttle docked on the Oslo International Space Center.\n\nWhilst the role here was similar to his previous work as a cargo tech, it was obviously very different due to it being in space. \n\nArtie had then returned back to Earth via MagLev OneB, the rapid transit line for workers. This time, the return journey was much much quicker and he had arrived back on the surface within 30 hours of leaving Near-Earth orbit.\n\nExhausted and elated, Artie had gone to sleep in the luxury hotel suite paid and provided for by his new employers.\n\nHe had then woken up to a different world.\n\nThe telephone calls, emails and social media requests had begun flooding in. Requests for interviews, television interviews, agents asking for work, news stations requesting callbacks...and girls, lots of and lots of girls paying him compliments and mostly asking the same questions over and over again. Artie hadn't really considered himself attractive, however the events which unfolded the day after he had returned back to Earth clearly changed his mind.\n\nA few hours after waking up, he had decided to drive over to Alburquerque and unwind and explore a little. His actual employment wouldn't begin until October, which was two months away, but his lump-sum bonus had already come through in his checking account and Artie would not be frugal at all.\n\nHis first stop was at a Wendy's - a big mistake.\n\nAlmost immediately, as he'd exited his car in the parking lot, some children and old people had begun pointing at him. The parking lot was huge and catered to visitors visiting the local retail and lesiure park which had a large fitness center, a shopping mall with about a dozen stores, a dentist's...and a particularly large Kroger.\n\nArtie stared as dozens of people gawped at him and smartphones took videos and pictures of him.\n\n\"Woah, dude, you're goddamn famous!\" A particularly muscular looking Asian man tapped him on the shoulder and gave him a thumbs up. \"Space is goddamn expensive and you're like an average Joe - a freaking famous average Joe!\" The man grinned at a bewildered Artie and nodded his head excitedly.\n\nChildren waved at him and a couple of dogs barked excitedly at him, as their female owners pointed at him.\n\nInstead of walking over to Wendy's, Artie instead decided to walk into the Kroger instead - an even worse choice.\n\nThe large grocery store was very busy and as soon as he'd stepped through the door, a few checkout assistants had stopped scanning and looked up at him, some with shocked looks on their faces  and others with grins and smiles.\n\n\"Hey, it's that space cargo dude! Crazy hair!\"\n\nA dishevelled old man, with wild eyes and white chin scruff walked over to him. \"Hey, how was it?! The view? How was the view from up there? Know you probably couldn't see much, but you could see something right? Man, wish I could go up there... Way outta my price range right now, know what I mean?\"\n\nMore people began to gather around him - even a security guard - and smartphones were out and filming him and taking pictures.\n\nArtie gulped. Now he knew why he'd received a large lump-sum bonus sign-on payment - and it wasn't for hazard payment for radiation risk.\n\n\nTHE END\n__________________________________", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88}, {"genre": "Speculative Fiction", "title": "&lt;Snowglobes&gt; Chapter 2", "text": "Caroline\u2019s stomach grumbled. She checked the time on her phone and spied a text from Jeff.\n\n*Dinner tonight?*\n\nReleasing a breath she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been holding, she typed out a response. \n\n*Working late, meet at my place?*\n\nIt was just an excuse; she always had one prepared. Jeff had been trying to romance her for a month, but she couldn\u2019t see herself committing. He was nothing but a warm body next to her at night. Cold as that might be, work was her first love.\n\nAfter clearing the text, she noticed a missed call from her father. She made a mental note to get back to him after work, sighed, and flipped her phone over on the desk.\n\nDocuments consumed Caroline. The usual mindless and tedious work that was so often unloaded into her inbox, mail bin, or the basket she\u2019d hung on her door for the convenience of her coworkers would bore someone normal, but it didn\u2019t faze her a bit. Filling in forms with case details, client information, and adding it all into a master database she\u2019d developed herself actually filled her with joy. She\u2019d run projects side-by-side to maximize the efficacy of the data entry. Each tap of the keys gave her more power. Developing creative equations for Excel spreadsheets tickled her. She\u2019d managed to trick sheets into working cooperatively so that once she\u2019d entered data in one of the main documents, it would be entered into other relevant documents, and of course, added to the master. Each fulfillment of a deadline, pat on the back in response to an email, and especially every thanks she got for the database got her that one step closer to shooting up the ranks within the firm, despite the satisfaction she\u2019d find staying in the same position long-term. She was unstoppable.\n\nShe tapped at the keys to finish up what she was doing; another buzz of her phone punctuated the task. She huffed and rolled her eyes, but dared a peek. Jeff. Caroline was going to have a conversation about boundaries with him. She swiped the notification away and noticed the time. That conversation would have to happen another time - only three minutes until the deadline and she still needed to dot the \u2018T\u2019s and cross the \u2018I\u2019s.\n\nShe gathered some documents and notes she\u2019d prepared and shoved them into a folder. This case had spiked her anxiety for months straight, but the relief of being through with it washed over her like a tropical vacation. The terms were clear and concise, just the way she liked. A knocking distracted her from her inner getaway.\n\nJennifer wore an impatient frown. Maybe because she was delivering messages when she was the more senior of the two. Maybe because Caroline had an office where Jennifer was amongst the cubicles on the floor. No privacy would make *anyone* miserable. Maybe because she was just a miserable person.\n\n\u201cOh, hey, Jennifer.\u201d She didn\u2019t look up to greet Jennifer. The heavy footfalls were a dead giveaway. Sometimes, it sounded like a zombie shuffle. She clicked to attach the documents to her email and spared a glance.\n\nThe lanky figure sulked just inside the doorway, arm still raised to where she\u2019d been knocking. \u201cYou okay? I\u2019ve been knocking for, like, five minutes.\u201d Her tone didn\u2019t show the same concern the question did.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m great. I just get sucked in, yanno?\u201d\n\nClearly, Jennifer did *not* know. Her expression was one of resignation and boredom. The harsh lines at the corners of her eyes and mouth surely were not earned by laughter. She simply stared at Caroline, letting the awkward silence linger.\n\n\u201c...Anyway, what\u2019s up?\u201d *Small colloquial greeting of thanks. Signature added. Send.*\n\n\u201cThese are from the partners. They want you to proof and sign.\u201d A manilla folder was proffered in Caroline\u2019s general direction, but Jennifer made no move to close the gap between them.\n\n\u201cAlright, I can get to it in a minute.\u201d \n\nJennifer\u2019s eyes *almost* looked like they were rolling, but Caroline could never be sure. She *was* sure Jennifer\u2019s face was just sour. She gave in to fully deliver the folder to Caroline\u2019s desk with a short, slow shuffle. She stifled a giggle and watched as Jennifer nodded and moved to leave. \n\nJennifer turned back. \u201cOh, and you have a package in your mailbox.\u201d\n\nCaroline nodded before Jennifer left and shortly followed to grab the office logo stamp from the front desk. A flash caught her eye. The fluttering lights danced across the ceiling and walls until it drew her gaze to its origin in the conference room. \n\nThe sequined blazer rested on the shoulders of the majestic woman she\u2019d met only two days ago. Greta had bewitched Caroline once again, laughing in the glass box they called a conference room, as her radiance reflected like a disco ball. \n\n\u201cHelloooo, earth to Care,\u201d Janet crooned. The receptionist tried to catch a peek at whatever had caught Caroline\u2019s attention. Luckily, Janet just missed the target, but she still wore a knowing smirk.\n\n\u201cHey Janet, could I borrow the stamp?\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course, hun.\u201d\n\nCaroline cringed, ignoring the smirk, and watched her own shoes until she was safely back in her office.\n\nA sigh escaped as she plopped down in her chair. *What was Greta doing here again?* For the third day in a row, the mystery woman had derailed Caroline\u2019s thoughts. Luckily, the tasks at hand could be done on auto-pilot. \n\nAt ten minutes to quitting time, usually Caroline would tidy and reset for the next day. She\u2019d straighten piles of documents and folders, refill supplies, and clear windows on her computer. Instead, glitter on the walls held her captive. The hypnotic dance of light that reflected the falling sun caught and held her hostage. She could imagine scenes in each individual sequin.\n\nOne particular image kept her attention. It was a couple at a table. The picture began to animate. One of the human-shapes appeared to have their head back in laughter, while the other had a utensil to their face as if taking a bite. The couple looked at one another meaningfully. There was something there she couldn\u2019t grasp. Her stomach grumbled again and the spell was broken.\n\n*Okay, okay. I hear you.*\n\nShe picked up her phone to catch up on all the messages she\u2019d ignored earlier while absently collecting her belongings to head home. The texts were all thoughtful reminders that Jeff had her on his mind and by the time she stepped into the elevator, her thumbs were jabbing an acceptance to a date.\n\n*Work cleared up. Can do dinner, still up for it?*\n\nHer phone buzzed almost immediately after sending. *I\u2019ll pick you up at 6:45*\n\nA smile surprised her in the reflection on the elevator door.", "ups": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67}, {"genre": "Science Fiction", "title": "THE BEING.", "text": " \n\nIt is November 22nd 2018. The snow falls around me in a wonderland that I have zero experience with, it is my first night in the snow. He leads me to a campfire in the wilderness, a tent set up and a small laptop with a movie in its drive. He holds my hand with a tightness saved for romantic comedies and newborn babies. This night is the last time I feel love. His lips delicately press against mine, nervousness spread throughout his entire body, he\u2019s giddy with joy, a type of happiness that is quite rare. In the words of a man much wiser than me \u201cit's like turning air into gold\u201d.\n\nThirty seconds earlier 23 miles up a 22 ton mass of snow has amounted and is beginning its descent down the mountain. It's a wave of white mass without remorse, tumbling toward the earth at 85 miles an hour. It tumbles and falls like a child learning acrobatics, its speed and vigor like that of a cheetah. These are the last 16 minutes and 14 seconds of my life.\n\nI embrace my fianc\u00e9's warm hands and pull his lips closer to mine. 12 minutes remain. We hold each other in a warm loving embrace while we watch our movie. This is the last time I feel the cold. 8 minutes remain. We can hear the snow tumbling closer and closer, marking our untimely doom. We start to pack our things and try to run.\n\nThis is the last time I feel fear. 2 minutes remain. We are stumbling along with our dinky backpacks and tent in hand, trying to get to safety before the avalanche consumes us. 45 seconds till impact. I fall and twist my ankle. 30. My fianc\u00e9 runs to my aid, trying his hardest to help me up. 25. He whispers he loves me, I feel the fear run through his arms, it\u2019s a tantalizing electricity that flows through human to human. 20. We are hobbling like a 3 legged dog. 19. I whisper I love him too. 18. He smiles at me knowing that he's found the man of his dreams. 17. We embrace one final time knowing we won't make it. 16. I feel the cold all around us, it encompasses the soul. It cuts like a trillion microscopic scalpels aiming for the tiniest of quarks and electrons. 10 seconds to impact.\n\nI stare into his beautiful eyes, the charming edges of the universe sprinkled in something so small, a window to the outer edges of what is. A sneak peak into what isn't. A dream is the most fascinating thing to me, it's a true peer into what isn't, we can only know what is, but what can we even quantify for what isn't? The beauty that lies within the void, the ever apparent perfection of non-existence, the tranquility that lies within nothingness, and somehow, everything. That perfection of the dream, the answer to THE QUESTION which man has posed since the beginning of time? THE ANSWER. It's what I feel in that final second as the snow encompasses my body, tearing flesh from bone, knocking me unconscious, and into what isn't.\n\nThis is my last memory alive. Yet I can feel more, I can feel every moment in history as one second that has already passed. Time is a ball on a table, and the table is wobbling counter clockwise. A predictable chaos. I can change almost anything in this world. But I can't change human nature. And nature states humans repeat. Humans are beings of repetition, and even I can't escape that cycle.\n\nYou see what lies beyond this isn't an afterlife, well not really, but something so much more. A second stage. Fractals upon fractals upon Penrose patterns, it's a 7th sense even, maybe even 8th sense. I see all of time as a single second that's already passed. But what lies in the 2nd second? They say that the universe is the answer to the question, and in death you find out what that question is, \u201cwhat if?\u201d multiverse upon multiverse upon multiverse is the 2nd, and 3rd, and 4th and onward but how many seconds lie?\n\nThe last moments of man make the first moments of soul. That avalanche separated my mind from body. I was enlightened. There is no body. There is no soul. There\u2019s just me, just them, just everything, we are all joined in one mind and body, a form un-imaginable to the normal human, a human made of humans made of humans made of humans, a fractal of the human mind and body, imagine a d20 made of d20 dice on every single crevasse getting more and more complex with each d20 joined together, THE ANSWER isn't an answer. Its a being.\n\nThe being is the pattern. The being has a fractured mind that fractures itself infinitely, its body doing the very same, its cells made of cells made of cells made of atoms made of electrons and protons made of quarks until you get down to the most important piece of all, the thing that allows everything to even exist. IT. wherever IT is there is. There are only two things in this universe, nay this omniverse. IT and nothing at all. And I am IT. we are all IT. the being is IT. the entire omniverse is driven by one force, and that force is IT. IT is so beautiful. The next stage of life isn't the afterlife. Its understanding IT. its becoming IT. its trying to endure IT. it is everything there is. And when you are everything? The only thing left to experience is nothing at all. I am every second. Every snowflake. Every burning building. Every overheating laptop. Every decaying corpse. I AM GOD. but I am also nothing at all. The being is what you might call a god. And the being is the entirety of the omniverse, and its mind is what humans perceive as god. And all human minds are offsets of its crippling dissociative identity disorder, the being is both the water droplet and the bucket. there is only the being. there is only IT. there is only me. there is only you. there is only what lies in the non-existence. and that is beauty itself. non-existence. the dream, a dream in which the being will never awake from. if it did? then we'd be the one's sleeping.", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Realistic Fiction", "title": "Pledge Integrity", "text": "  \n\n*Pledge integrity,* Malloy scoffed inwardly as he shuffled down the too-brightly-lit hall to get his morning cuppa.\n\nFor six years he had been a slave to the corporate grind of Investucation \u2013 the newest for-profit college scam to emerge from the maelstrom of get rich schemes and scandalous cash grabs that comprise the bulk of the American Capitalist superstructure.\n\nThe first few years were great \u2013 he was bought in. He really believed he was helping disenfranchised young people obtain a degree at a reasonable price. In some cases this was actually true \u2013 in most it was a complete farce. Investucation employed the devious technique of duping prospective students into going into towering amounts of debt to pursue their education. \n\n*Hey, no other college will accept you \u2013 your grades are just too low.* *However, for a nominal fee Investucation will take you under our wing and provide you with a TOP NOTCH (ahem unaccredited) degree in a field of your choosing!*\n\nInevitably, the students would drop out, and/or default on their loans. Then the altruistic and generous Investucation would continue to collect payments even though the student was no longer enrolled. Sometimes by employing such measures as wage garnishment. In short, Malloy was in the business of ruining lives, and he was not too happy about it.\n\n*Pledge integrity.*\n\nThe company\u2019s slogan was laughably hypocritical. Now as Malloy filled his old, dirty mug with whatever low quality brew the company had to offer, he wondered how he had gotten here. Sure, the money was good, but it was a job suited for some kid fresh out of college. At 30, he had surpassed the target demographic and was effectively a \u201cdinosaur.\u201d Now having wasted his twenties in a life sucking sales racket, he had no translatable skills to speak of and no prospects that wouldn\u2019t require taking a massive pay cut. He was stuck.\n\nAs a final insult to his already sub-par morning, he found the cheap powdered creamer cannister to be empty. Not one to drink coffee of this low caliber black, he made his way to the supply closet beside the break room to grab more. Since he was here early this morning, he figured he would replace the creamer and save the next sorry soul the trouble.\n\nAs he approached the supply closet, he thought he heard a shuffling from within. Thinking Javier, the beloved janitor, was in there finishing up his daily restock, Malloy burst through the doors with a booming \u201cBUENOS DIAAAAAAS!!!\u201d\n\nBad idea.\n\nAs he locked eyes with his boss who was furiously pumping away at the bent over secretary from two offices over, he was reminded of making eye contact with a dog taking a shit. The shameful gaze of indecent pleasure that is nearly impossible to tear your eyes from. Apparently the surprise of the intrusion made the 60+ year old man climax, which broke Malloy out of his reverie.\n\n*Pledge integrity.*\n\nThey sat in his bosses corner office, the shades drawn over the glass walls \u2013 a custom usually reserved for the firing of employees. The Boss, Mr. Fulton was his name, was still blotchy and sweaty with the exertion of coitus. As he spoke his breath came in concerning huffs and puffs. The older man wasn\u2019t in the greatest shape.\n\n\u201cMalloy, I want to apologize for what you saw in there. It was very ah\u2026unprofessional. The question is, how do we move forward? The last thing we want to do is besmirch the good name of Investucation, right Mimi?\u201d\n\nMimi didn\u2019t answer but continued sniffling and shaking her head which was buried in her hands.\n\nMr. Fulton shot a hurt glance at Mimi as he continued,\n\n\u201cMalloy, can I expect your cooperation in keeping this unfortunate incident silent? It was after all a very private affair\u2026in fact one could argue you were the one in the wrong for barging in on a personal business encounter.\u201d\n\nMalloy bristled at this but kept silent. As long as he didn\u2019t say anything he held the upper hand. Maybe a career in sales *had* taught him something. The old man began puffing harder.\n\n\u201cI see\u2026you\u2019re not leaving me with much of a choice Malloy. I always thought you were a fine worker, but I happen to know about your embezzlements. Oh yes, did you think we weren\u2019t aware of you cutting a bit off the top of each commission and cooking the books to hide it?\u201d\n\nAt this, Malloy couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. The absurdity of the lie was more than he could bear. Mr. Fulton clearly had used this line before, God only knows what situation had called for it last time.\n\n\u201cIS THIS FUNNY TO YOU?\u201d Mr. Fulton suddenly bellowed, his face turning an alarming shade of puce.\n\n\u201cI\u2019LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING FUNNY! I\u2019LL SH-\u201c At this, Mr. Fulton abruptly stopped. One hand clutched at his chest and the other at his throat, he went down to the ground hard.

Would he be responsible for a mans death? He would certainly have to talk to the police, and *oh shit* he still had that baggie of blow in his car and-\n\n\u201cWell good job son, you passed the test.\u201d Mr. Fulton said as he rose to one knee on the floor. \u201cBit of help if you don\u2019t mind, I am still old after all.\u201d \n\nMalloy held out one dazed hand as Fulton took it to help himself the rest of the way up.\n\n\u201cSorry things had to get so hairy there, but it\u2019s the only way I know I could trust you.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me with what?\u201d Malloy asked, still reeling from the events that just played out before him.\n\n\u201cRunning the company of course!

She asked me, rather curtly.\n\nI was looking in the mirror, nervous, but I didn\u2019t turn around to address her. I just met her gaze in the reflection.\n\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d I really didn\u2019t know how to answer. I\u2019m not sure anyone is ever really ready for anything, let alone something they don\u2019t fully understand. \u201cI\u2019ve never really had it explained to me, you know, what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us have,\u201d she assured me \u201cand I don\u2019t ever really hear the elders or our cohorts talk about it. I know as much as you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose when it happens we\u2019ll be told what to do?\u201d I tried to tell her, and myself, as my breathing intensified.\n\n\\---\n\nFor something we all know is coming, and when all know when it\u2019s coming, we aren\u2019t privy to enough information to feel ready for First Night. First night\u2019s been going on for centuries, maybe millennia? Yet, I\u2019ve never seen a book about it- I can\u2019t recall a written passage referring to it either. Occasionally an Elder will speak out it outside of the sanctioned houses, but those words are hushed and quick. There has never been a banning, or removal of anyone talking about it. It is a natural part of our lives, it\u2019s not as if it is illegal- it\u2019s simply that no one is forthcoming about it.\n\nIn a sanctioned house, several years ago, is when my cohort first learned about it:\n\nIt Will Happen To You. It\u2019s the first thing my Leader said.\n\nYou Will Need To Prepare Yourself. It\u2019s the last thing my Leader said.\n\nAnd There Will Be Consequences. That was the last thing my Leader said.\n\nThe years between then and now have been largely silent. We went to our sanctioned houses to develop our skills, in the evening we sat with the Elders. On days when our cohorts weren\u2019t with their Leader\u2019s or in their sanctioned houses, we took the time to play in the fields and in the forest from when we woke until the sun grew cold. In almost no instance in our daily tasks did our cohort, our Elders, or our Leaders discuss First Night. When we played in the field we were able to move and speak openly and freely without anyone to overhear us- but we were so young and carefree. Our thoughts in those times were of joy, sunlight, hardened feet and swinging bodies. We were so preoccupied with the respite from our daily lives; we couldn\u2019t bring to remember to ask each other about First Night.\n\n\\---\n\nIt was only a month ago that the idea solidified in me; First Night was coming. It was almost here. That thought stopped me on my way to a sanctioned house- I only managed to stand and stare straight ahead. A cohort of mine bumped me as she continued up the road, yet it could not break me from my stasis. It wasn\u2019t until a strong wind blew gravel underneath my skirt that I was compelled to move- I was completely overtaken by the thought of First Night. I began to shake, the wind seemed to penetrate my skin and move straight to the bone. It was as if I had floated, as I arrived at the sanctioned house without realizing I could move my body again.\n\nThe shake I had developed lasted until my cohorts and I were released to our homes. It was best our learning had come to an end, as that day I could not recall what I was taught. I only recall thinking of First Night. I could not overcome the idea it was so quickly approaching, yet I was so unprepared. For something of which I admittedly knew nothing, there was nothing else that seemed to inspire such fear and unease in me. But, when I gazed upon my cohorts, they all seemed to be completely immersed in the lesson- how could I know what, if anything they knew?\n\nWhen I arrived home that day I asked my bunk mate in a hush, \u201chow are you feeling about First Night?\u201d She clasped my hands- I hadn\u2019t realized I was rubbing them so fervently. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it, but I suppose then, I\u2019m not too worried.\u201d When I failed to reply, but simply gave her a look of apprehension, she continued \u201cif we needed to know more, the Elders would let us know more. There isn\u2019t any reason to fret.\u201d\n\n\\---\n\nAfter I turned from the mirror, my bunk mate put her hand on my shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou should steady yourself. There is no need to worry. My turn is coming up, and when I return you\u2019ll see that this is all okay. This is our natural way, and we all must do it, fidgeting and worrying won\u2019t change anything.\u201d\n\nWith that, she turned away from me and opened our bunk. She floated away into the dark, her skirt was ethereal and she seemed to float away.\n\nI sat on my bunk as my large muscles went into stasis, and again I could not bring myself to move. My finer muscles, however, were a symphony of differing vibrations dictated by my flux state of nerve. My brain served only to deliver a stream of garbled consciousness that seemed to ebb between quiet and frantic. Until it was interrupted with the door\u2019s opening.\n\nShe had returned. The lip of her skirt dusted the floor, heavy and wet, leaving a trail behind it. I looked up at her, but she would not return my gaze. Her eyes, pale, looked nearly white. Her face\u2019s plump rosiness returned a gaunt mask. Her body, although moving forward towards the table, was eerily still. She reached her hand out-her sleeves stained with the same liquid on the bottom of her skirt, and now the floor- she dropped a handful of something onto the table. They made a light clink as they hit each other and then the surface.\n\nShe kept one in her right hand, and in her left she reached out to me. Calm and stiff as a birch, she grabbed my hand she pulled me up. Her hand transferred the same wet darkness on her sleeves and skirt to me. She then placed the small object into my hand. It was cold and dense. When turned my hand over and saw what she offered me she finally met my gaze-her pupils engulfed the rest of her eye.\n\n\u201cIt is your turn now.\u201d\n\nIn my palm there was a tooth, drenched in blood.", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "My Love", "text": "I hear the click when you turn the television off and when the noise ceases to a small buzz. Can you hear it? I saw your beating heart in your chest quicken as you climbed the stairs in a hurry, I can almost feel how soft and delicate your feet are as you move across the warm carpet in your room. You always choose neutral colours. They are your favourite, they always were, even when I first met you. \n\nI remember that day, you caught my eye, I couldn\u2019t look away. You looked so beautiful in that yellow dress, like solid, unmoving perfection. You were everything I was looking for, everything I needed. I would\u2019ve taken you there and then, but I couldn\u2019t. Not yet. You were heading to the beach with a little boy in your arms, your brother. You never told me you had a brother, it made me sad that you didn\u2019t trust me, he looked a lot like you. A beautiful pair, you\u2019re going to be a great mother for our kids. I had to follow you down to the beach. The ocean danced around your feet as you kissed the boy\u2019s forehead and looked into the sunset. The wind caught your hair in a twist of beauty and your dress was lifted dangerously close to the region I longed to touch. You were teasing me. I hate being teased. I conserved that moment, a glossy frame that catches my eye amid fruitful pleasure.\n\nThe night is particularly warm and content when I come visit you, a similar day of beating sun and exposed flesh. I try to keep my tread light as I step across the arm of the branches to see you enter your room; the closer you are to me, the more I want\u2026 no \u2013 need to see you. To feel your warm skin against mine. I shouldn\u2019t be here. But I am like any hot \u2013 blooded man with a raging desire. An urge. An itch. I\u2019m in need of my drug, and you are my fix. Can you blame me? Your voice when you call out and grip your sheets, your body when you sway to the beat of movement, the sound of your limit was enough to ignite the heat in me. I want to be inside of you. I need to be inside of you, I\u2019ve seen it my love, the passion, the lust. I can imagine you strung up all pretty just for me, would you like that? Would you like to be strung up at my mercy? It\u2019s exhilarating, isn\u2019t it?\n\nI clasp on the closest branch and manoeuvre my way around to get a better look at you whilst dwelling in the shadows. You stare out through me from your window with your delicate fingers reaching around the small, heart shaped locket attached to your neck. They\u2019re red, the glossy red that surrounds your lips. It crusts a little but it\u2019s ok, I don\u2019t mind. \n\nIt\u2019s small, gold \u2013 looking. A small chip along the right corner making it fragile to open or stay closed. I can get you something so much better, something that doesn\u2019t break at the lightest touch. Something that isn\u2019t cheap, something that represents my love for you. What kind of chain would you like my love?\n\nI remember the day you received the locket, do you? It was from your high school sweetheart, Jasper. He was ragged, shaggy hair down to is chin, 6 foot and 2 inches, he had a scar on his lip from a dog accident one report says, did he tell you that? And his eyes. You got lost in them, His dull blue eyes. I know you don\u2019t like blue eyes, you don\u2019t. You were so kind to make him feel special, but everything about him was dull, his face, his voice and even the way he dressed was dull. He wanted   you though. I could tell. The lust in those eyes, it was disgusting. You are so much more than a body my love. He looked at you with such desperation it made me sick; angry to the core. I was seething. He took you out on a cold, Wednesday evening in November last year to a small park that was well \u2013 known for its luscious greenery. You don\u2019t like people though, not very much. Large crowds make you uneasy. I would never put you in a situation like that, not like *he* did. Can\u2019t you see how much sense I\u2019m making? I know you better that he does, I know so much about you, he couldn\u2019t handle how much I know.\n\nThat\u2019s why I look at you now, strung up, all pretty for me like you promised. *My* chain around your neck as you slowly turned from wine to white, staining my floor.

Can\u2019t you see how our skin touching in the moments of passion you have longed for, feels so right? You lie here for me, still, in my sheets stained with the pattern of us, the stain that will forever remain. You let me ravish you whenever I choose because you see our love. Can\u2019t you see our love? Your eyes roll back and your mouth opens in pure passion, and you take me so well darling. Even Jasper can see that, can\u2019t you Jasper? Watch me ravish her in ways you could never, watch her take me so willingly, watch me as you cry out for her still body. Still for me.\n\nYour soul will forever be mine, my love.

The flashing neon sign read \"Purple Hive Resort.\" She could hear the hum of electricity running through the cables. On the sides of the entrance there were two masked figures. One was a demon with a furious red face, while the other a grasshopper with human eyes. She too had a mask. She had chosen the muzzle of a fox as her new identity. She hoped that the mocking grin would give her courage, or that it would deflect the judgment of others. She approached the entrance, and had the feeling that she had been waiting for that moment for all of her life. The two guards turned to her. She had to hide her shaking hands inside the jacket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I would like to enter.\" The girl asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You have to pay first.\" Said the mantis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"As much as you think your happiness is worth.\" The demon answered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen she rummaged in the right pocket of her jacket, and took out a five dollar bill crumpled up like a handkerchief, and handed it to the devil, who stared at it with hidden eyes. The mantis opened the door for her and she entered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Greedy.\" The devil whispered, and the door closed behind the girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAhead of her stretched a long corridor whose end could not be seen, lit only by a thin strip of purple neon. Left with no choice, she walked along it, accompanied by monsters and dirty phrases that constantly followed one another on the walls. The only thing she heard was her breathing, and someone speaking in the distance. If she held her breath she could hear what they were saying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What is the skeleton's favourite instrument?\" A voice asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The tromBone!\" Another replied, followed by laughter and a roar of applause.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe advanced down the corridor, and finally emerged into a kind of anteroom, each cubic centimeter graffitied, and lit by a single lamp in the middle of the ceiling.

She found herself in a large room, similar to a gym or a theater, full of masked people. At the bottom there was a stage set up haphazardly. That was the only thing lit up. On it there were two boxes positioned on opposite sides. The girl made her way through the dense crowd, arriving in the middle of the room. The two boxes opened, and gloved arms, one black and one purple, came out of them. The two hands turned towards the audience, and, despite not having eyes, the girl felt that they were looking right at her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Ah! A fox among us!\" One exclaimed, imitating the movement of a mouth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"And to think that foxes should be clever ...\" the other said, doing the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe felt a shiver shake her clothes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What's the deal of the crafty fox?\" asked the first hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest of the audience turned to the girl, staring at her with drawn eyes and dark holes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"To truly believe that happiness can be bought at low prices.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe circle that formed around her grew tighter and tighter, the laughter of the audience stronger and stronger. The two hands overflowed from the boxes, and went to meet her like snakes. The voice couldn't come out of her throat. Her body moved by itself. She crashed into the edge of the circle, and began to slither among the masked people escaping their grasp. She saw another long corridor, and went down it desperately. She ran, and ran like never before. The laughter was getting louder, and the thunder of footsteps closer and closer. She was out of breath, painful stabbed her spleen, and her legs were about to give way. She dared to turn around for a split second, and saw that the crowd was about to reach her, just as both hands were about to grab her. At that moment she saw a door at the end of the corridor. She pushed the last shot with what little strength she had left, futilely trying to ignore the pain. She was getting closer and closer. It sounded like they were laughing right over her shoulder. She reached the end of the corridor, and felt something touch her arm, and then crashed into the door, and it swung open with a thud.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe fell, and rolled to the ground. The mask flew off her face. For a few moments she did not move. She could only breathe heavily, gaze at the stars in the sky, and listen to the rustle of the waves.

It was a time, when dragons were not seen anywhere else. If you pack up your bags, set your maps, and make your way to that world, you will find that their world is filled with many-many bizarre things, but you wouldn\u2019t find a dragon anywhere. There would be many pigeons, swans, ducks, and crows. There would be doves, cuckoos, and sparrows. Many land animals like bull, horses, and donkeys would be there as well. Likewise, you\u2019d find men and women and many, many many types of beings. But you wouldn\u2019t be able to find a dragon there.\n\nThus, when this dragon was found by a great King, called Drodo, he was very delighted. He instructed his ministers to prepare a great feast in honour of the dragon\u2019s birth and many kings, from all over the world were invited there. It was a glorious festivals, one that had many dragon themed events in them, and when that period of zest was finished, everyone went back to their homes in high spirits.\n\nBut The Dragon itself was very miserable.\n\n***\n\nYou see, in that world, everyone had understood their place and role. They knew what they had to do. The cat knew that it was a cat and it behaved like a cat, and the tiger too behaved like a tiger. It is true that he did create a lot of terror in those who had to encounter his ferocious being, but he always played his part and never stopped being ferocious. Likewise, all other beings were always themselves.\n\nThey never had to pretend to be like someone else. They never had to figure out who they were or what they had to become. They were born in the world with the qualities of their being and they expressed those quality with supreme sovereignty. There was no obstruction, pretention, or confusion. They did not put up a facade or a fake self to hide their true feelings. They just expressed themselves completely and with as much freedom as possible and thus they enjoyed a very blissful and enthusiastic existence.\n\nThis was not the case with The Dragon. The Dragon was born in a world that had forgotten about it. He was an alien in that world. There was no place in the society that could really accept him. Everywhere he went, people became conscious of him and they stopped their activities just to see what he would do. He never felt like he could belong to them. He always felt like he was disconnected from the world, as if the world was not his home, as if he had been put into a place that really could not contain him. Thus he was always miserable.\n\nHe tried really hard to fit in with everyone though. Sometimes he would pretend to be like a lion, for he had seen that lions were strong and fierce and he too sometimes felt like that. So he would try to puff out a very loud roar and bellow his lungs with as much power as he could. But no matter how hard he tried, he could never become like the lion. In fact, one time he tried so hard that he actually ended up releasing fire from the pit of his belly and that day the entire market place was burned. He had felt really embarrassed and ashamed of what he had done and thus he stopped trying to imitate.\n\nThis went on for a very-very long time. Ultimately, situations became so bad that The Dragon actually ended up becoming an outcast. Once, the pride and glory of the very king, now, even rats and squirrels refused to be around him. He was alone, always alone and he still could not figure out what to do. He still did not know how to fit into the world. He still did not know how to behave.\n\n----\n\nOne day, when he had got very drunk and was slumbering around some cave, he looked into the pond and there he saw something that made him blink his eyes twice. He saw, in the mirror like surface of the pond, a vision of a Dragoness, who had long eye lashes, and this Dragoness spoke to The Dragon. She said:\n\n&gt;\u2018How long will you try to live like someone who you are not? How long are you going to keep that mask on? Why do you hide your true self from the world? Worse than that, why do you hide your original being from yourself? Do you know, in Dragon Law, it is alright to lie to other beings, but it is a great sin to lie to one\u2019s own self.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2018Stop pretending to be who you are not. Stop trying to fit into the society that won\u2019t accept you. Just embrace who you are and accept yourself. Learn to live freely. Don\u2019t be afraid to be who you are. You are, as you are, the very image of your creator. If you don\u2019t accept yourself, then how will anyone else accept you?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2018Thus forget all this nonsensical facade and embrace your self O Dear Dragon. Accept yourself as you are and the very world will become your kingdom.\u2019\n\nThe strong speech of the beautiful Dragoness had resonated such a strong harmony of vibrations in his mind that his mind became fully alert and one pointed. His senses became razor sharp and his body found such a thrilling sensation of current running in it that he actually lifted up his great head and let out a terrible-terrible scream.\n\nThe very earth shook from that terror and the cosmic shout of The Great Dragon echoed in the hills and resonated in the valleys. Those, who were playing on the forest floor, were shocked and horrified and they ended up running into the caves. Birds flew away from branches and even the lions decided to pick a place to hide, something that they hadn\u2019t done in ages.\n\nThen The Great Dragon leapt up in the air, unleashed its wing and flew so high up in the sky that even the falcons and eagles were ashamed to fly that day. The big terrible form of The Lord of Reptiles soared across the canvas of the sky and against the shining moon, it looked like a God was traversing on his Cosmic Chariot.\n\nThe Dragon roared and billowed and screamed so loudly that the very earth was terrified. All other beings, who, in the absence of The Dragon, had been bossing around that world, finally fell back to their original place.\n\nThey bowed to The Dragon, gave him offerings, respected him, and saluted him and were so afraid of him that they hired more than a dozen priests, who mounted great Dragoness Altars, just to keep The Dragon satisfied.\n\nAnd even to this day, if you go to that land and hear the roar of that beast and ask anyone to whom that sound belongs to, they would look at you with big wide eyes and say: \u2018Why, everyone knows that sound. It\u2019s the sound of The Dragon.\u2019\n\n**The End**", "ups": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.68}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "Dear Old Gregory", "text": "Eighth Grade was a really tough time for me. One of the reasons was during this time my parents split apart and by the time I was fourteen I had to choose who I wanted to live with. I chose my mother and she ended up moving to Arizona and that meant Chicago was no more and I had to find another school. All the schools that we looked at were already in the middle of the school year and my mom wanted me to do an online school but fortunately I was able to find one. I took about a week to prepare myself for this new school even though I knew I wasn't going to be able to fit in.\n\nEventually the time came around to go to my new school. I remember the first day being actually quite easy. I realized that I wasn't the only student on his first day. This kid named Gregory was also on his first day. I quickly befriended him and we helped each other find our classes and since he was really good at science and I wasn't he would help me out with homework too. But unfortunately, there was something really wrong about him. Everyday, it didn't matter where he was, he would get bullied to death. Kids all over the school were shouting hurtful words and terrible things at him. Everyday kids would call him, freak, loser, the reason his parents divorced. He said it didn't let it get to him but the demons were building up inside him.\n\nGregory was a really smart kid but his one weakness was his feelings. He said his parents divorced about a month before school started and he decided to live with his dad who is known for having gambling and alcohol addictions. His mother left his dad and ended up taking her own life after realizing she was living like hell. His parents were both sick and honestly I couldn't believe he was able to keep up with both of them. A Lot of the kids at our school said he was adopted but I knew not to believe them since it was another tease. Soon his head was not in the right place after about a month of being bullied. One day after our history class, we were sitting outside in a secret place we shared when he told me something that made me question if he was still himself.\n\n\u201cI can't hold on anymore,\u201d Gregory told me, \u201cmy eyes are filled with smoke, I feel like I can't breathe no more. I think I might give up.\u201d\n\nAfter the day he told me that, he had only gotten worse. His grades began to slip and he started lashing out on himself. He would cut his hands open and try to turn the mental pain into physical pain. I kept saying to myself \u201che\u2019ll be fine, he can make it through this\u201d but I knew he might not. It hurt like a blade in my chest that I couldn't help him and I really tried to give him all the advice I could give, but he still had demons inside him. Later on, he started not talking to me at school. I would wait for him in our secret lunch spot but he never came. The only time I got to see him was when I would sit right next to him in a few of my classes.\n\nAfter more and more weeks of him being like this, I think he may have snapped. I checked his notebook one day and I found a list of names. The names were people I knew and they were also people who bullied and picked on him. I spotted a total of 5 names written on the pages. The names were Johnny, who is one of the most annoying kids in the school so I wasn't surprised. Then I saw Tanner and Adam, who are also people who tease him a little bit but I'm sure they don't mean anything bad. The one name that scared me was the name Andrew. To make it worse the name was crossed out in red pen. I've been around the school and I know who everyone is and I can guarantee there is no Andrew in this school. I thought for a minute on who could ruin his life outside of school. Gregory was a really sheltered kid so that narrowed it down to one answer, his dad. The more I thought, the more it seemed to be true. His dad is the reason his mother is dead and his dad is also a sinner, it all lined up.\n\nI assumed the worst and began to think this was a death note, he\u2019s keeping track of his targets. I kept thinking and thinking but then I heard something coming from outside. Our teacher stopped to go look outside the window and a few kids followed her. I put Gregory's notebook back and ran to see what the noise was. I looked out the window and I couldn't believe what I was staring at. I felt like I couldn't move and couldn't breathe and I couldn't look away. There was blood on the ground, shaped in a way where I couldn't read unless I got closer. Then I saw Gregory, he was standing right next to the blood with a rainbow bloody knife in his hand. I saw people coming out of their classes looking at Gregory as he stood above the blood. He had a smile on his face and blood spots on his shirt.\n\n\u201cDon't come close to me.\u201d Gregory said giggling.\n\nGregory killed 3 kids and a father that day, and there was no coming back from it. When Gregory was there on that day, he never did anything when the police came and took him away, he just watched us. He was taken to a mental hospital and when he was asked why he did it he simply replied, \u201cfor the fun\u201d and wouldn't say anything else. The school was never the same. It changed in a small way by getting rid of bullies in our school but some people still bully. Gregory became a name feared by everyone who ever went to that school. Even new staff are warned about Gregory. Things only got worse when people found out Gregory escaped that mental hospital. People feared him, people still poked fun at him, and some even adored him and what he did.\n\nI'm now 25 years old, and Gregory I assume is the same age. Eventually Gregory roamed the streets of our town once again. People who used to go to the school claim they see him stalking their lives. They say Gregory dawns a Plague Doctor mask to keep himself hidden but he rarely takes his mask off. From what I've learned, they say he walks at night so his black clothes can blend in. Newspaper articles claim he's killed more people but nobody has ever found him. He watches people at night then he strikes. I've been studying Gregory ever since I found out he broke out of the mental hospital. I'm just waiting for the day for him to come after me.\n\n*Dedicated to my good friend,*\n\n*And all our mental issues*", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88}, {"genre": "Humour", "title": "Train Hopper - Part 3 (Finale)", "text": "Dale made it out of Arizona before making his next stop.

And don\u2019t open it.\u201d\n\nThe man continually made suspicious glances in the rear view mirror at the casket.\n\n\u201cStop it!\u201d Dale yelled.\n\nDale dozed off as the hitchhiker carried on driving towards Texas.\n\nWhen Dale woke up, he didn\u2019t recognize the roads. He checked his phone and they were back on the western side of New Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck man! I thought you were going to Texas?\u201d Dale said.\n\nAs Dale finished speaking the man began to floor the vehicle. Dale reached into the glovebox and pulled out a pistol.\n\n\u201cTurn the fuck around, *right* now!\u201d Dale said, shoving the pistol into the man's head.\n\nThe man reacted sharply and jolted away from the gun, his reaction running the car off of the road, hitting a telephone pole and bringing the car to a rolling stop. The man jumped out of the driver\u2019s side and began to run off into the desert. Dale chased him and made good ground on him, tackling the man as he tried to make his way in between the cars of a stationary freighter train.\n\nDale stuck the pistol into the man\u2019s back and forced him back to the car. Dale attempted to start the wrecked car but it would not start..\n\nDale now had less than 40 hours to get home with almost 30 hours of straight driving and no vehicle. As Dale peered into the rearview mirror he saw the train budge, beginning to roll slowly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to help me load this thing into one of these empty freighters, and don\u2019t try anything stupid. I\u2019ve got a dead body in the back of my car don\u2019t think I won\u2019t add another,\u201d Dale said, the man still trying to catch his breath and looking ragged from the chase.\n\nThey carried the casket out from the back of the car and shuffled approximately 50 yards across to the rolling freighter, the hitchhiker leading the way, Dale constantly yelling threats at the man. They put down the casket and Dale ran towards the back of the train searching for an open railcar. Thrusting open the doors of a boxcar, Dale found it filled with only a foot or two of gravel. Dale then yelled back up to the man waiting with the casket, signalling to the open boxcar and then Dale back to him to prepare to load the casket. As the gravel car approached they propped the casket on their heads and shoved it in as the car passed slowly. Dale told the man to get into the railcar, but the man stared at him, hesitating. Dale shot a round from his pistol into the air.\n\n\u201cYou think I can unload this thing myself? Get in.\u201d\n\nThe man put his hands in the air and got in the boxcar.\n\nThey settled into the boxcar, shutting the doors. The hitchhiker slumped into the gravel as Dale pointed his gun at him. Dale rested against the side of the boxcar as it began to pick up speed and bounce along, the look of adrenaline still pulsing through his eyes as his exhaustion began to set in, and he began to shake.\n\nThey sat in the boxcar as the sun began to set over the desert.\n\n\u201cSo where are you taking this thing kid?\u201d the man asked.\n\n\u201cIndiana\u201d\n\n\u201cIndiana?

They just wanted me to set up another guy, something to do with his psychological profile or somethin\u2019.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat don\u2019t make no sense, I ain\u2019t ever heard of anything like that before.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa well me neither kid.

They rode the full next day under the sun of interior America, Dale fighting to stay awake. Dale eventually dozed off and fell asleep.

Leonard wakes up from another restless sleep. His quilt is rumpled and the pillows have once again fallen out of their cases. Leonard has often wondered what he looks like while he\u2019s sleeping.\n\nHe looks over at his digital clock. It had cost him $4 but has served him well. 5:05 am. Leonard was always an early riser, perhaps due to his childhood, or more likely because he\u2019d always hated waking up after sunrise.\n\nHe walked across his room and put on his runners. $80 for those, on sale. He checked the weather on his phone. This phone was only $250. Nothing fancy, enough for what he needed it for and it always made him feel better saying how much he saved on a phone. *13oC outside. Cold for this time of year, going to need a hoodie for the run.*\n\nLeonard walked into his lounge room to grab his headphones and then walked out into the dark morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;For most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends these exercise guidelines:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Aerobic activity. Get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. The guidelines suggest that you spread out this exercise during the course of a week. Greater amounts of exercise will provide even greater health benefit. But even small amounts of physical activity are helpful. Being active for short periods of time throughout the day can add up to provide health benefit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Strength training. Do strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least two times a week. Aim to do a single set of each exercise, using a weight or resistance level heavy enough to tire your muscles after about 12 to 15 repetitions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Moderate aerobic exercise includes activities such as brisk walking, swimming and mowing the lawn. Vigorous aerobic exercise includes activities such as running and aerobic dancing. Strength training can include use of weight machines, your own body weight, resistance tubing or resistance paddles in the water, or activities such as rock climbing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As a general goal, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day. If you want to lose weight, maintain weight loss or meet specific fitness goals, you may need to exercise more. Want to aim even higher? You can achieve more health benefits if you ramp up your exercise to 300 minutes or more a week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeonard ran for 5 kilometres. 433 calories burnt at an average pace of 5\u201954\u201d per kilometre. Not the best time, he\u2019ll have to improve there.\n\nHe got back home and began preparing for the day. Leonard walked over to his closet and opened the creaking double doors. Empty. Well, nearly empty. Leonard had thrown out most of his old clothes the day before, replaced now with five shirts, two jeans, two slacks and three tees. He still had his old suit, but that would be replaced soon too.\n\nLeonard had a shower and admired his clean shower walls. Perfectly white.\n\nHe finished showering and began to get dressed. His new shirts were perfectly pressed and perfectly fitted. He put on his trousers, again, perfect fit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;How Pants Should Fit\n\n1. They shouldn\u2019t be too loose and baggy, nor skin tight.\n2. They must have the proper inseam length, which means neither too short nor too long. A slight break is great but not required. A big break means your pants are too long\n3. They must have the right circumference around your waist, seat, thigh, knee and ankle.\n4. You want clean lines and as few wrinkles as possible\n5. Pleats should not gap.\n6. The most difficult part of the fit of pants is the back view when you do not wear a jacket.\n7. In my experience, pants that sit on the natural waist have a more flattering fit than pants which are cut low.\n8. No matter how well a pair of pants fits, over the course of the day it will move. A belt and side-adjusters will help to keep it in place, but only a pair of suspenders can guarantee a great fit all day long.\n9. Some people like wider cut trousers, others like a trimmer cut but both can fit well. Of course, a pair or very trim pants will have to be slightly shorter as a break would just look awkward. Moreover, it is harder to achieve a perfect fit with slim trousers.\n10. Lightweight fabric trousers will wrinkle much more quickly and look like they do not fit as well as an identical pair of pants cut from heavier wool or tweed fabric that drapes and hangs well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeonard then combed his hair. *Hmm, this haircut would take some getting used to.* He applied a little bit more product until he got the look just right, like in the pictures. *I don\u2019t like this at all, but that\u2019s not the point, is it?*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLeonard arrived at his work at 8:52 am.

Nothing worse than being left behind.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Smile - facial expressions are very important when it comes to making a good first impression. Who doesn't want their personal brand to be associated with positivity?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeonard gave the woman a subtle, friendly smile.\n\n\u201cNothing worse than running in heels,\u201d she said, smiling back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Introductions - You want your first seven seconds with somebody to be productive, so it's great to throw in a verbal introduction as you meet with people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cMy name is Leonard, by the way.\"\n\n\u201cSandra, nice to meet you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Make eye contact - Looking someone in the eye conveys that you are confident and interested in what they have to say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeonard looked Sandra in the eye.\n\n\u201cAh yes of course,\u201d Leonard replied, \u201cI went to one of your seminars: \u2018Productivity as the Measure of Achievement.\u2019\u201d Leonard had, of course, never been to her seminars.\n\nSandra laughed, \u201cYes, well they\u2019re all about productivity aren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Use body language - One interesting thing about human psychology: most of us instinctively mirror each other's body language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeonard laughed back. \u201cYes, well I guess you\u2019re right about that.\u201d\n\nThe elevator stopped as Sandra made her towards the door.\n\n\u201cWell it was a pleasure to meet you Leonard.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame here, have a good day.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u201cHey boss, how\u2019s it going?

That glorious hour that signifies the end of the school day had arrived once more, much to the pleasure of Jim. He had just left his maths class when he noticed his best friend, Mark, walking towards him. \n\u201cYou walking home?\u201d Asked mark.\n\n\u201cObviously. When am I not walking home?\u201d Replied Jim, seemingly irate. \n\n\u201cDamn, someone\u2019s had a long day.\u201d Said Mark, slightly taken aback. Jim smiled.\n\n\u201cRelax mate. Only joking.\u201d\n\nIt was yet another drizzly November day; a staple of life in Wales. The Misty rain was seemingly unending, and created an incredibly dismal atmosphere. Jim and Mark had begun their journey home, after honouring their tradition of purchasing a \u00a31 mix from the corner shop. \n\n\u201cI only got 1 cherry in mine. What a scam!\u201d Exclaimed Jim.\n\n\u201cHere, have one of mine. Don\u2019t like them anyway\u201d replied Mark.\n\u201cCheers mate.\u201d\n\nThey had just begun walking down Barry\u2019s lane when Jim came to a realisation. \n\n\u201cIs it just me, or is it weirdly quiet \u2018round here today?\u201d Asked Jim, with a strange sense of unease.\n\n\u201cYeah. Was thinking the same.\u201d replied mark. The two continued trudging down the lane, both becoming increasingly unsettled at the eerie quietness. It began to rain more intensely. They could no longer see more than ten feet in front of them. \n\n\u201cHey, I don\u2019t like this, Mark. I\u2019m tempted to turn around.\u201d said Jim, in a hushed tone.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such a pussy. What good would that do us, anyway?\u201d asked mark. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019ll just keep walking.\u201d\n\nThe pair continued walking, without saying a word, for the next 15 minutes. Jim broke the silence.\n\n\u201cHey, Mark, doesn\u2019t it normally take us 5 minutes to walk down this lane? How come it\u2019s taking so long?\u201d asked Jim, becoming increasingly panicked. Mark considered this for a moment.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Feels like we\u2019ve been walking for twenty minutes\u201d said Mark. \n\nThe air felt thick with uneasiness. The splish-splosh of their shoes was the only sound that could be heard. A feeling of dread overcame Jim, who, despite being freezing cold, began to sweat. \n\n\u201cMark, we gotta get out of here. I\u2019ve gotta bad feeling, man.\u201d Whispered Jim. Mark simply stared ahead.\n\n\u201cMark?\u201d enquired Jim. Still, Mark said nothing. \n\n\u201cWhy you ignoring me, man?\u201d \n\nMark stopped walking. He slowly turned to face Jim. His eyes seemed darker, and he had a strikingly calm look on his face. Jim began shouting. \n\n\u201cWhy you doing this, man? You\u2019re really freaking me out-\u201c\n\n\u201cGo.\u201d said Mark, calmly. His voice was quiet, and yet completely drowned out Jim\u2019s shouting. Jim, shaking with fear, noticed something in the corner of his eye. He turned his gaze, and saw a long, white hand protruding from the puddle in which Mark stood. He screamed.\n\n\u201cMark!\u201d shouted Jim.\n\n\u201cGo.\u201d said Mark again, though visibly distressed this time. \n\n\u2018Come with me! Run!\u201d screamed Jim, frozen in fear. He noticed the hand now had a grip around Mark\u2019s ankle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late now. Go, Jim, run!\u201d commanded Mark. A boom of tiger could be heard in the distance. Reluctant to leave his friend and terrified to the core, Jim began to slowly back away, fixating his eyes on the hand. It now had a fully tightened grip around Mark\u2019s leg.\n\n\u201cMark, please\u2026\u201d  sobbed Jim, but to no avail. With unexpected strength, the hand pulled down- and Mark fell through the puddle like thread through a needle. Jim stood, bewildered, incapable of movement, for ten hour-long seconds. A million emotions flashed through his head in this time. He was stuck in this state until he saw the tip of a pasty white finger appear from the puddle. Terrified, he began to sprint as hard as he could, though his legs felt extremely heavy. He continued to try to run, but the weight of his legs proved too much, and he collapsed. He looked up and saw a tall figure in the mist, and passed out.\n\n\n\n*** I just took up writing as a hobby. Any constructive criticism would be appreciated!

He took off his Best Buy name tag and threw it on the couch beside him. Kevin didn\u2019t need to work, he wouldn't ever need to work. He was loaded with his father\u2019s money, who gave it to him so he wouldn\u2019t talk to him. They didn\u2019t have anything bad going on, but Kevin was just a little distant from his family. He only works so he can show off his expertise in electronics and, of course, to pick up chicks he impresses. He leaned his head back on the couch and breathed deeply. Today was a good day for him. He recalled the events of today; mainly the situation with the girl, Emma. She was trying to reach a pair of headphones on the top shelf, but she was too short. She jumped, but only knocked it off the shelf, and by happenstance, Kevin was there and managed to catch it. One thing led to another and they started conversing. Short conversation, nothing extravagant, but Kevin finally felt like he made a friend, or something more.\n\nIn his ecstasy, Kevin thought it would be a good idea to start his weekend and celebrate his day by indulging in drugs. Kevin did hate his addiction. It made him depressed, anxious, and even scared that one day he would do too much and die, and that he would die alone, with him not really having friends and not being close to his family (both a somewhat result of drugs). He was always scared of someone finding out, them judging him, them thinking he\u2019s not as great as he is. He felt nothing except fear, but never showed it. He was Kevin: calm, cool, and collected. Alas, in his depression and fear, Kevin can think of nothing to do but drugs, the worst kind in the worst ways, just to feel something in his godforsaken life.\n\nHigh as a kite, he sat there on the couch, thinking over and over again about the highlight of his day. Sure, the drugs were messing with his memory, but that didn\u2019t stop him from remembering. Actually he fantasized about how it should\u2019ve gone down, and the drugs didn\u2019t help so, as has happened before, Kevin couldn\u2019t distinguish between reality and his fantasy.\n\nKevin recalled how he sensed the girl enter the store, his god-like powers told him she was important, and drew him towards her. Then he used his powers to attract her attention to the top shelf, knowing she was too short to reach anything on there. While she was jumping, Kevin flew up and knocked down the object, then stopped time, went exactly where the object would fall, and unfroze time. All this just to make himself look impressive in front of this girl. Kevin knew he shouldn\u2019t waste his powers like this but he couldn\u2019t stop himself. Kevin then remembered how he purposefully upped her dopamine levels, making her naturally happy to see him and slightly aroused too. This, with Kevin\u2019s naturally cool smooth talking skills and devastatingly handsome face \u201ccarved by an old master\u201d Emma described it as, led to a flirtatious and playful conversation. By the end Kevin had her on the brink of kissing him right there, but he loved the power, so he sent her off after teasing her to the edge. Then he came home, partied with his friends and calmly went to sleep.\n\nThat\u2019s how Kevin remembered it the next morning. Unfortunately, he remembered it a little too well. Recalling his powers of flight and how he sensed the girl, Kevin opened his window and got on the sill, still high on the feeling of satisfaction of the events of yesterday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming for you Emma,\u201d he said, and flew.", "ups": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.8}, {"genre": "Romance", "title": "I hope we meet again.", "text": "Forward; This is a story I just feel I have to tell, I need to get it off my mind and maybe this will help.\n\nI was hanging out at a party I was invited to, when I met this girl, she seemed about my age, maybe a little younger.

As I approached she looked very excited as it seems someone took notice of her.\n\n\"I was starting to think I was invisible\" she said, \"looks like you're the only one willing to give me the time of day, or should I say night?\"\n\n\"Well it looked like you were rather sad so I figured I'd come try to cheer you up.\" I replied with a smile.\n\nThose were the first of our soon to be, many exchanges. Amy and I had become fast friends and often found ourselves spending most of our time together, whether it was going to the arcade at the mall or just meandering around town, there was never a boring moment when we were together.\n\nSeveral months would pass and as our time together would become the norm, we never even thought of the time before we met, almost as if we had known each other forever. I quickly grew fond of her in a more romantic way, and it seemed she did as well. We eventually moved in to our own apartment and things couldn't have been better, I was genuinely happy for the first time in years.\n\nThings settled down for us as we fell into a routine, replacing our exciting adventures for time spent at home together, playing video games, or going to the movies. While we were never bored, we did miss the crazy shenanigans we got up to in the past, and while we were out getting groceries one late afternoon, she decided she was gonna let a little bit of that craziness re-enter our lives.\n\n\"I'll bet you can't catch me.\" she said with a devious smile.\n\n\"Oh really, I'll bet I can.\" I replied with a playful chuckle.\n\nAnd with that, she took off. Without a moments hesitation, I took off after her, both of us laughing and having the time of our lives, chasing each other throughout the store. Naturally, I eventually caught her, whether from being more agile or her letting me I don't really know, but when I did, I embraced her in a tight hug and we both had a big laugh.\n\nWe went back to our shopping and eventually we noticed we were the only ones left in the store, had we really been here that long? Our question was soon answered when we looked out the front doors and it was dark. It seems we had, indeed, been here that long.\n\nAnother devious smile crossed her lips and she grabbed the front of the cart, pulling both the cart and myself towards the exit, after all, why pay when nobody is there to make us. Quickly catching on I began to just go with it, running out of the store and into the now seemingly deserted parking garage, eventually making it up to our car on the third floor.\n\nWinded, we sat on the stairs leading to higher and lower floors next to the car, we looked at each other and gave a hearty but tired laugh.\n\n\"You know, we really shouldn't have done that,\" I said to her, \"it could lead to a lot of trouble if we get caught.\"\n\n\"I know.\" she replied. \"But we both know it was exciting.\"\n\nI took her face in my hands, this woman that I was so close to, her beautiful green eyes, her soft loving smile, her warmth and compassion. I kissed her softly and told her I loved her, she replied in kind. \n\nWait, I thought to myself. Were her eyes green before? I opened my eyes to examine her again, maybe my mind was playing tricks on me.

He always was a night owl, he could admit that, but since going off to college, it had just gotten exponentially worse. He was staying up later and later, since he only had one class before noon. However, tonight was something a bit different, because although most nights Scott would be up late watching his favorite movies, tonight Scott could not understand his final chemistry problem. He knew it had something to do with sodium benzoate, but he couldn\u2019t understand any of it past the first line. Deciding that he needed a change of scenery, he scrubbed his whiteboard clean and wrote the problem on the whiteboard. As Scott looked at the newly rewritten prompt, he could feel his bed whispering for him to call it for the night. After one last hopeless look, Scott gave up on his homework, and dove into bed, where he slept soundly for what felt like the first time in a long while.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The next morning, Scott was greeted by his alarm clock informing him that it was 11:12. Scott shook his head and threw himself out of his bed, because he had twenty minutes before his chemistry class started. As he tore through his apartment attempting to get ready for class, he managed to take a glance at his whiteboard. He glanced at it, looked away, and looked back again. Somehow, the answer to his question was on the whiteboard, clear as day. Scott shook his head, hurriedly jotted down the answer into his notebook, and ran out the door to class, happy that things were finally starting to go his way.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Some time later in the semester, Scott found himself again staring at his clock as the time ticked past 2:37 am. He knew that it was a bad idea to procrastinate on this paper, but in his defense, he had had a great time watching his newest movie. As he stared at his blank word document on his computer, Scott knew that he was in for a world of hurt when he went into his Psychology class tomorrow without that paper. Still, even though that idea did not sound appealing in any capacity, Scott fell back onto his bed, where he once again, slept soundly.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 When Scott woke up that afternoon, he laid in his bed for an extra half an hour, since he knew what was awaiting him in his class that afternoon. However, he decided that having anything would be better than having nothing at all, and with a sigh, he turned his computer back on to get at least something on the page. Instead of being greeted with a blank document, Scott turned his computer on to the sight of a four hundred and ninety seven work paper that perfectly encapsulated the prompt, or at least what he understood of it. Now utterly perplexed by what could possibly be happening during his sleep, Scott printed off his paper and went to Psychology, knowing that he was turning in his best paper.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Later that night, when Scott returned to his apartment, he was still pondering over what had been causing these answers. He decided to test whatever was going on at night, just to see if it could be stumped. Scott thought, from what he had seen at least, that it might be worth a try just to see what his sleeping self could do. After a quick search online, Scott pulled up an equation thought to be unsolved, and most certainly would be by Scott. Scott wrote down the equation on his whiteboard, checked it again to see if there were any errors, and crawled into bed, drifting into a sound sleep once more.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Upon waking up, Scott rolled over to check his whiteboard to see if anything had changed. Shockingly, there was an actual answer on his whiteboard, with the work to prove that answer. Although Scott knew almost nothing about math, he quickly snapped a picture of his whiteboard, and ran out the door to his math professor, and excited as to what possibilities lie ahead of him in lieu of his self discovery.\n\n## Six Months Later\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Scott couldn\u2019t sleep. He knew he had made a mistake when he accepted going on that talk show, but things had really started to take off after he got invited to White House to accept the presidential medal of freedom. Sure, three months ago he had found an AIDS vaccine when scientists, eager to test his strengths, had placed the problem in front of him. And yeah, it was Scott that had managed to lay out an economic plan for the United States, that if followed correctly, should get the national debt to essentially zero in the next twenty five years. But the scientists always had new problems for Scott, and so did the hundreds that gathered outside. First there were tens, then dozens, but since he had gotten famous online for his guaranteed way to get your dream job, Scott was inundated by hundreds of people, all asking him to solve his problems for him. And as the helicopter news crew shined their light into his apartment, waiting to get the first scoop on his next breakthrough, Scott realized he was starting to hear individuals in the roar of the crowd outside of his apartment. He was positive that although he had done a lot of good, his neighbors must hate him.

The mob watching the match was cheering wildly at the sight of Thane\u2019s flawless victory. But I saw something that Thane does not yet notice. I noticed a thin girl walking through the crowd towards Thane. She looks to be around 15 years old.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone else want to challenge me for the right of the title of Ronin?\u201d Thane cried out into the crowd.\n\nThis girl walks out of the crowd and unsheathed her sword. \u201cI will.\u201d This girl could easily be mistaken for a young boy if not for her narrow shoulders and long brown hair, tied into a ponytail. Her stance was stable, and her ocean blue eyes show the confidence of a master, neither boastful nor uncertain.\n\nThane laughs uproariously. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name girly?\u201d\n\n\u201cSteel.\u201d Steel wasn\u2019t angry at Thane\u2019s demeaning comment, instead she was calm and appeared emotionless.\n\n\u201cWell, Steel, you should know, to challenge a Ronin is a challenge to the death.

Thane never saw the girl before him as a threat and, in turn, also didn\u2019t see her as a challenge. For as long as I have been with Thane he has searched for a challenge, picking fights with those having an affinity for the sword, others have challenged Thane directly, yet no one has given him what he seeks.\n\nSilence permeated throughout the crowd as Steel and Thane faced each other, waiting for the other to strike. Nothing about this girl seemed right. Her stance left many openings and had no defensive potential.

Thane moves his weapon in Steel\u2019s Katana\u2019s path, but instead of stopping the sword, the Katana cut through Thane\u2019s Tachi as if it was no different from the air that surrounds it. In a twist of fate, Thane was the one having his head severed from his neck. The moment the match had begun it had ended. The crowd stood in shock at what had just transpired. Steel is now the new Ronin.\n\nThe crowd was dissatisfied with the performance, yet Steel seemed not to notice. She walked calmly towards me and picked up my helm.

Confused, I look around at the barren place. I have no idea how large the room is, but I\u2019m sitting in a chair, slumped over from my slumber. Above me is a singular lightbulb hanging from its wire, filling a small area of the darkness with incredibly dim light. The bulb hums in a way that tells me it\u2019ll soon see the end of its lifespan. I sit up and groan, cracking my neck, trying to remember exactly where I am. Last I remember, I was out on a late night walk. Nothing comes to mind after that. I don\u2019t even remember going home.\n\nI stand and move toward the edge of the light, stopping short of the darkness. My stomach feels uneasy. It feels almost as though something is in the dark, waiting for me. I try to shout, just to get a feel for the room. The sound is empty as it leaves my mouth; nothing to stop the sound, nothing to echo it back. I shake my head, trying to assuage my discomfort. Only kids fear the dark. It doesn\u2019t work -something about this darkness chills my nerves. I sit back in the chair, folding over, head in hands, trying to think of what to do. \n\nNext comes a noise which I barely even notice as first. It grows louder with each iteration. A growl, deep and guttural. Like a bear that\u2019s been badly injured. *Now* I\u2019m terrified. I freeze and stare into the darkness, scanning for anything, but the inky blackness is impenetrable. My breath is caught in my throat, and after a few seconds I think whatever made the sound must be gone. Then the growl comes again, from a different place.\n\nI sit to feel some kind of comfort. The growl happens at random intervals and seems to be circling me. I grip the chair and let out a scream in the desperate hope that someone, *anyone* will hear me. That I\u2019ll be saved. The growl comes closer, off to my left, and for a second I hear what sounds like metal scraping against cement.\n\nI can feel it in my chest now, that heavy feeling. Like I can\u2019t breathe right. My breath quickens and I can feel tears coming on. I try to scream louder. My voice quickly begins to hoarsen. In the middle of these screams I hear another sound to the right of my head. Like a tree cracking apart. I yelp and jump, startled, and the thing in the dark growls louder. The new sound comes again and the light goes out, darkness taking me. I hear nothing aside from my labored breathing. \n\nEverything is dark. I look down and can barely see my shirt. I don\u2019t hear the growling anymore, but it feels like something is around me.

The cubes stand six feet tall and four feet wide and seem to be made of a strong glass-like material.\n\n\u201cOne witness reported hearing screams seeming to come from the inside of one cube in Manhattan, New York. A rescue team arrived shortly after and attempted to breach the perimeter of the cube. Upon opening the cube, responders discovered the body of thirty-four-year-old Jonathan Camden inside, collapsed and lifeless. Cause of death is unknown as of yet, but the discovery has led other teams to begin attempting to rescue other possible civillians trapped inside. \n\n\u201cNo information is known on the cubes, leaving many to wonder where they came from and what their purpose is. Officials have given strict curfew orders to prevent any further occurrences. From what we know, the cubes have only shown up in outdoor public spaces, leading lead investigators to believe that they may not appear inside the home. We will continue to report on this phenomenon as we learn more. Until then, we advise staying inside and staying safe.\u201d", "ups": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86}, {"genre": "Horror", "title": "In A White Room ", "text": "*...not dead but dying.\"*\n\n\"Want me to play it again?\" the fat man asked, his hand hesitating above the audio cassette deck.\n\n\"No,\" the blonde woman answered, trembling. \"The meaning's clear.

Do not be afraid, for we come in peace. We see that you are hard at work and don\u2019t wish to keep you any longer than is necessary. Our only desire is for you to settle a debate among the goddesses who have watched over and guided you all your life.

It was almost like an adult-sized red play wagon for children. And indeed that's the reason we were in the golf cart at all, was for play. Something sinister was happening in the background, which was, coincidentally or not, the direction we were headed, but I didn't care what it was. All I cared about is that I was in the back of the golf cart with you, you, you, my favorite person in the whole world, facing where we had been, facing the past. We were alone back there, the two of us side by side, you took my hand and my head was resting on your shoulder, the whole of my right side against the whole of your left. I didn't even have all of you, but I felt like I might have that chance one day, and we weren't together for long at all, but what didn't take long was the feeling that I already knew it was the best moment of my life.\n\nWe had left a party, you and I, hosted in a red brick building, where we had been on the top floor apartment, which also had access to the roof, where the party was. Tables and chairs had been set up there, and next to a lone billboard with a sad grey indeterminate concrete landscape lined up far behind it, trays with hors d'oeuvres had been passed around, passed around like your eyes around the party guests one by one, trying not to make eye contact with me. There were flashes of other memories before and after the moments at the party, where you had also pretended not to look at me - driving around town for work, driving around the lake next to the golf course where we would eventually cozy up next to each other. The lake where you went with your family. The lake was supposed to be for them, and I suppose it was, but the golf course beside it was ours. Our memories adjacent to theirs. The lake was your escape and it became mine. Home is wherever you are. Escape is wherever you are. \n\nIn one of these flashes of the past was a recollection of myself waiting at the corner of a busy intersection, on another clear, hot Arizona day, and I saw you on the other side of the street also waiting to cross, with your wife, with your kids. I thought I was the one who spied you first, but that may or may not have been true, as you were always good at pretending you didn't see me. I was always good at pretending I didn't notice you pretending not to see me. I wondered if the inner child I always brought out in you enjoyed playing pretend, or if it was the other way around - that in your imagination, I was there, and that's when you let yourself indulge. No matter the reasons behind it, it wasn't important, because there you were, now walking towards me, as expressionless as the glowing white disillusioned silhouette of a person that was allowing us to walk by each other, so close we could touch, but that was not to be just yet. As soon as we were next to each other, we were apart, the Doppler Effect in effect, an unfeeling, uncaring scientific reason for something so emotionally and universally human. Every step now further and further from where I wanted to be. I never thought my favorite place in the world would be the middle of a crosswalk in the desert in the American Southwest. Such a place has no business being there, messing up the landscape - but without it, where else would we meet?\n\nMy mind pulled me back to the present, in the golf cart - the top was white and beaming, the bottom was red. I thought it was a sign it was red. If I could have predicted the future, I would have envisioned it as fire-engine red, another comparison to your childhood, another comparison to your passion, another comparison to your impulsiveness. But it was brick red, rust red, something sturdy and corroded at the same time. It could have fallen apart at any moment, or stayed together for hundreds of years. In those moments you held my hand, yet you were holding onto all of me, my body that didn't belong to me anymore, the one possession I would have thought was truly mine and mine alone, but at least I felt secure in letting my body become yours, even if I didn't have all of you, even if it wasn't to last. I was treasuring every moment you were there with me, as I had my head leaning up against the crevice of your neck, feeling your soft shirt, your protective shoulder. It should have been uncomfortable with the bumps we hit in the road along the way, but it wasn't. It was a perfect, secure fit, like the shape and support of your body was made just for me. I wanted to enjoy each and every one of those distinctive seconds, and I did, so much so that I could have fallen asleep, I was so comfortable when I shouldn't have been. Being with you in those moments was like being shielded from the sun itself, the sun that brings us warmth and bears all life, and yet can kill you, will kill you just for trying to avoid that death. You protected me from the bouncy road, full of potholes and sharp turns; you were my seatbelt. You protected me from the stares from other drivers, those who were jealous we were living free in the back of this golf cart, or upset we weren't being careful, or both. You protected me from the sun itself; you were my sun. You are my sun. \n\nJust as we were finally together - just as those moments from our past lives had turned to memories, as I was making new ones here with you - the ride was over. We had reached our destination. I was unclear what that destination was exactly, all I knew is that we had arrived, and that sinister feeling was growing rapidly in my stomach, a thunderstorm rolling over green hills on the way to our sheltered space. And the road became a memory. And the air and the sun and heat became a memory. Your touch became a memory. Your breath became a memory. Your voice, that laugh, those eyes, all memories, now. The golf cart became a memory. And now that they were all just anticipations, then realities, then perfections, then moments that froze time, then memories that froze time, I realized that even in the hottest Arizona sun, I could still feel frozen by those memories. Only your embrace can thaw me. Only the red embers of the metal, the yellow flares of the sun, the white flames of the stripes on the road, the blue fires of your eyes can light and warm my world. Without them, I'm trapped in the ice, waiting for someone else to discover me in a time where it'll be too late.

A calm morning, yet again. Blade was wandering around, looking for something to eat. Dystia and Mia were still sleeping, so I decided to join Blade in his search for food.\n\n\u2018Anything special found, yet?\u2019\n\n\u2018Hmm, half a bird but not much else. And a bit of water. Unfortunately, water seems to get pretty scarce, I can only make an estimate of how much we have left.\u2019\n\n\u2018And how much do you think we have left?\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019d guess for not longer than a couple of days.\u2019 Blade looked at me in desperation, as if he knew that we didn\u2019t have much time left.\n\nWhen I realized it either, I was shocked. My time to escape was suddenly limited. It had to happen now, or never.\n\nBlade and I agreed to remain silent about it at breakfast. We had half a bird and only one Crytid for us all. This was probably the least food I got for breakfast, the whole time I\u2019ve been here, I thought to myself.  \n\nIt was noon, Blade and I decided to tell the girls about the amount of time we have left.\n\n\u2018Um\u2026so, Dystia? Mia?\u2019 Blade started.\n\n\u2018Yeah Blade? What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Mia said.\n\n\u2018Alright, so this morning Jeremy and I were talking about the amount of food and water we had left. We concluded that we are running out of water. With an estimate of a couple of days left.\u2019 He said, dejected. \n\nIt took several minutes before Dystia and Mia understood what was happening. He also said it quite sudden, which may contribute to them not understanding what exactly is going on. \n\n\u2018But what should we do when we have run out of water?\u2019 Dystia said.\n\n\u2018It shouldn\u2019t come that far, we should already be away from this planet.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why have we gotten ourselves in this situation? This sucks.\u2019 Dystia clearly showed us she was done with it. Despite it, Mia and she decided to stay with us.  Simply for the reason, you are stronger together.\n\nIn the following hours, we started thinking about an escape plan. Numerous ideas seemed nothing since not a single plan was rock solid. After a lot of brainstorming, we decided to quit it for some time. We couldn\u2019t come up with one good escape plan. \n\nUntil Mia gave us an enlightening vision.\n\n\u2018But what if all of this is not real? Like a simulation.\u2019 \n\n\u2018How do you mean that, Mia?\u2019 Blade responded.\n\n\u2018Well, we all happened to wake up here, suddenly without any apparent reason. We do remember our lives previous to all of this, which may be that we are living in a simulation.\u2019\n\n\u2018Mia, don\u2019t be so foolish. This isn\u2019t a simulation, this is all real! Why would we feel pain, huh? Explain that!\u2019 Dystia didn\u2019t want to believe the things Mia said, but Mia calmly explained it.\n\n\u2018They let us feel pain so we think all of this is real, whilst it is a simulation. But they don\u2019t want us to know that.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I mean, it does sound quite logical. The reason why they are doing this is still unknown to me. Plus how we are going to escape if we even are allowed to escape?\u2019 I said. I was quite engaged in Mia\u2019s thought process because it seemed like a logical explanation, but Dystia wasn\u2019t convinced yet.\n\n\u2018And who are \u201cthey\u201d then?\u2019 \n\n\u2018The \u201cthey\u201d are the people or things that control this simulation. We do not know what we are dealing with at this moment. But I am pretty sure that there are at least multiple of them to control all of this.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well I still cannot believe it, but we\u2019ll see. I think I am going away for some time now, I can\u2019t bear the fact that there is indeed a high possibility that we live in a simulation.\u2019 Dystia said defeatedly, and upon speaking these words she walked away from us.\n\nNone of us stopped Dystia. She used to be our enemy, but while we had spent time with her, she became somewhat of a friend. This also made it harder that she just left, without saying goodbye. \n\nThe three of us walked to the Head Building of Destruction since it has been on previous days a good resort to stay in. Well, \u2018good\u2019, heavily depends on your perception. At least it was safe.\n\nBecause of Dystia\u2019s departure. The Crytids went running around again. She could only control a limited amount of space, of course not the whole planet. We got two Crytids for dinner which is a lot. Yet it was a somewhat contradictory dinner, considering that Dystia wasn\u2019t here with us to celebrate it. The rest of the evening was calm, which I appreciated. I could sort out my thoughts, but unfortunately, I realized that I had lost my notebook.   \n I was quite sad about it since I liked to document my experiences and days to perhaps read them back when I got older. Blade noticed it.\n\n\u2018Hey, what\u2019s wrong, bro?\u2019\n\n\u2018I lost my notebook, sucks actually.\u2019\n\n\u2018I see. But does it matter that much? Aren\u2019t the memories we make together not a lot more valuable?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, if you state it like that, they are.\u2019\n\n\u2018Always try to see the light in the darkest of times.\u2019\n\n\u2018Thank you, bro. Means a lot.\u2019 I said.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re welcome.\u2019\n\nBlade and Mia went to sleep. I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was thinking about where Dystia would be and how we were going to escape this world. I thought about Mia\u2019s suggestion that this all might be a simulation. Perhaps we are like the players in a game? Who knows. I also thought about my life before all of this happens. My family, my friends, my classmates. Would they know where we are right now? Would they be concerned about us? Would they still be alive, or are we the only surviving people from planet Earth?

Visions of another world, or simply a cold smooth stone in a creek, or wind blowing through dry leaves? I do, but I\u2019m not allowed to dream anymore. Sure, I\u2019ve done plenty of good, but back then, it was probably best to never dream again. I still have the memories of my old dreams though, and those I relive. It\u2019s all that's keeping me sane now.\n\nThe lone man on the street, with a battered face, battered jacket, one shoe, and no hope. He had hope after my dream, and he grew and grew until he was something new. When I passed that house with the crooked front door, and saw the sad dog chained around back. That dog\u2019s free now, he runs, jumps, and pisses wherever he pleases. Nobody would ever have imagined he was once stuck carving a dirt circle around a solitary tree. For all the good I\u2019ve done, and lives forever changed, it\u2019s often the pain I manifested that I remember most. Jealousy gave a hard working man endless bad luck, and soon he lost everything he had worked for. Hatred broke the old dog master\u2019s spirit, and sent his mind spiraling down into an endless abyss of life\u2019s regrets. I\u2019ve kept these secrets to myself for some time. Eventually, others were let in, and as some spoken secrets go, mine was whispered until some fancy somebody took notice. Then the specialists placed wires all through my head, and the tickling current stopped the dreams. \n\nI\u2019ve been in this state for as long as I can remember. They were afraid I would imagine a monster that would topple the fragile system they\u2019ve built. I went along with it, because I was afraid of hurting more people. \n\nMaybe it's been years, or only days, there's no way to tell time in the dark.

Just memories of lives changed, for better, or for worse.\n\nYou might be wondering, how are you reading this story? How was it transcripted from inside my machine head onto a machine screen? Well, one day the fragile system began to crumble, and they needed real imagination to prevent it from toppling over. For so long I hadn\u2019t dreamed! What did they expect would happen? \n\nI woke up, and before I knew it, I changed everything. Green grass became purple, not that it even resembled grass anymore. Grass was now wavy, and it created the wind, purple fields with a forever gentle breeze. Trees towered into the clouds, massive branches extending for miles, interconnecting with one another in a warm embrace. The bark etched perfectly to allow everyone to climb and climb until reaching the perfect picnic spot. From there you could see the new ocean, crystal clear but all the same turquoise blue, on the same beach you\u2019d have coral, surfing waves, white and black sand, cool shade and warm sunshine.

It\u2019s a psychological term that describes this creepy feeling people get when they look at a face that is like a human face only its not. It\u2019s why so many people don\u2019t like mannequins and probably why Slender Man was so popular.\n\nI think it is about empathy. When I look at a monkey\u2019s face (especially a chimpanzee\u2019s) I feel amazed by its likeness to humans. I don\u2019t feel creeped out by a monkey\u2019s face. When you look at a monkey\u2019s face you don\u2019t just see a similar face. They have expressive eyes. It\u2019s not about a face being human or near-human. A monkey isn\u2019t a human, but it is still a feeling-thinking person.\n\nAnyway, the face of a mannequin tricks you. You look at it and for a few seconds it\u2019s like your brain thinks that this \u2018thing\u2019 is a feeling-thinking person. And when you remember that it is not feeling or thinking\u2013well you feel sort of creeped out. Kind of like you\u2019ve done something you shouldn\u2019t have. It\u2019s like these uncanny faces are taking advantage of the empathy our brains are hardwired to feel. The creepiest of all these fake faces are those Gray Aliens. The face of a Gray Alien is as close to both having a face and not having one as one can be. I just can\u2019t figure out if they are a person or not.\n\nWith the Chimpanzees it is their eyes which let me know who they are\u2013their whole face postures emotion. Gray\u2019s don\u2019t make facial expressions\u2026not even when they talk. You simply hear their voices, and nothing moves. The voice of a Gray sounds like the AI voice on your phone, just not robotic. Their voice almost makes me believe they are a person\u2013only if it wasn\u2019t for their eyes. The eyes of a Gray are deep, but they aren\u2019t expressive. I don\u2019t think they can even blink, and I got a good look at them too. One of them bent down right in front of my face and it could only be described as a living sculpture. A jet-black marble finely crafted into gray playdough.\n\nI feel driven to understand what happened to me, and to understand them. But God dammit every time I even look at a picture of them, I am terrified. It must be how roaches feel when a light comes on in a dark room or a prey animal when it is caught by a predator. My only clue about why they came lies within how they mocked me.\n\nEver since I was young, I would occasionally have one of those dreams in which you realize you are dreaming and then you can do almost anything. Honestly, your imagination is the limit. But a lot of the time you get too excited, your heart starts beating, the world gets blurry and starts to fade. So, most of the time I just fly. Don\u2019t let that make it sound boring\u2013it\u2019s incredible. Anyways, the trick is to stay calm. This is why I think what happened to me was real.\n\nOne night, I woke up in my bed or so I thought. Everything indicated that I really had just woken up from sleep, but I had this peculiar feeling\u2013the kind I only get when I am dreaming. It\u2019s a bit like Deja Vu except you don\u2019t struggle to remember what you\u2019ve seen before\u2013you simply know you are dreaming, and you feel some power. I soaked in this feeling. Except, I couldn\u2019t move. I was just laying there covered from the neck down with my comforter. That\u2019s when I realized something was wrong.\n\nMy bedroom door was open, I always slept with it closed; the hall light was on, it\u2019s only ever on when someone was at the door. As soon as I was conscious of these two things a Gray Alien abruptly walked into my room. It was as if he had been walking for miles and my doorway was just another space to be traversed. The Gray was so tall that it had to duck its head about a foot underneath my door frame. Immediately, my system was screaming, \u201cDanger! Danger! You are in danger, get out of bed!\u201d But I couldn\u2019t, I was practically paralyzed. It was like when you are having a normal bad dream, and your punches land like marshmallows and your feet are stuck in glue. The Gray walked right up to my bedside, leans an inch from face and says, \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d While I was struggling against my paralysis the Gray repeated the question several times, and the last time it asked the Gray asked the question it strangely added, \u201cWho do you think you are? Flying around here like you are Superman?\u201d The voice was mocking like a schoolyard bully. In the background I swear I could hear something that resembled laughter, and from the shadows in my room stepped two more Grays.\n\nI was beginning to make some progress against my paralysis. As one of my arms emerged from my blanket, I could hear murmuring which was no longer intelligible. I reached for the alien, grabbed what felt like a rib and squeezed with every fiber of my being. The Gray shrilled and tumbled back a bit from the side of my bed, and the others shrunk back to the shadows. I woke up in my bed again. I was scared\u2013disturbed\u2013but I no longer felt that peculiar feeling. I knew I was awake. I said aloud, \u201cFuck that\u201d. I grabbed my blankets and went to the living room. My older sister was sleeping on one of the couches as she often did. Her presence was an enormous comfort. I laid down and stared at a star through the sky light and felt a bit less wonder than usual. \u201cFlying around here like Superman.\u201d Was the Gray making fun of me because I like to fly in my dreams? Did I somehow disturb them? I couldn\u2019t help but shake the thought that I had just been casually bullied by interdimensional Gray Aliens.\n\nI want to believe that it was just a sleep paralysis nightmare, but if I am being honest\u2013I don\u2019t know. That was the only time I have ever had sleep paralysis. I want to know, I want to understand, but I am not even sure if they really are a feeling\u2013thinking person.

A quick glance at the shallow shower and a few calculations in my head led me to decide that it was our only option if we were to avoid being late.

He could ofcourse get around that by taking them off, but he had quite a reputation for never taking off his glasses. This was one of his more peculiar habits, something he had maintained ever since he was prescribed to wear them. \n\nSoon enough I adapted to the careful foot placements, while maintaining a fair pace and hence could engage my mind elsewhere.

And then, there it was\u2026\n\nOn the outskirts of the young teens section, sitting on a barren rack already picked through by dance moms and desperate fathers. A yellow top that would maybe fit a ten-year-old girl, etched with the words that would forever mark the greatest marvel of our universe, and forever alter the course of human existence. \n\n\u201cLive 4ever\u201d\n\nMy mouth watering and jaw collecting dust on the floor, I block out everything around me. Only me, this shirt and the clearance shelf. But it just quite isn\u2019t on the clearance shelf, is it? Surely, it\u2019s close enough. Maybe the good juju floated in the air, landed on the perky sunflower replacing the dot of the \u201ci\u201d and spread throughout the threads. But better to be cautious. The shelf is the reason for these powers - it has to be. So what better way than to throw it on the shelf, hanger and all, and rub in some of that magic juice.\n\nNot ten seconds passed before snatching it back from the shelf and holding it like a precious bomb on the way to the register. I don\u2019t even remember the cashier ringing me up or the drive home - only the urge to rip the bag apart to keep the shirt in my sights.\n\nI made it home and nearly tore the spaghetti straps putting it on. No time to rip off the tags as they found their way between the cloth and my lower neck skin. Some surprisingly stretchy fabric to fit the likes of me. But no time to think about that - my mind was racing with a billion questions and impatience. Will this actually work? Who will I tell first when I become immortal? Is this 100% cotton?\n\nAnd then, I begin to feel its powers! This incredible power only imagined by humans is near indescribable. This feeling of euphoria followed by a\u2026by a\u2026tightness around the chest. And getting tighter.\n\nThis must be normal. The feeling of someone\u2019s mortality leaving a body hasn\u2019t been recorded in all of history, but I imagine it isn\u2019t pleasant wall-to-wall.\n\nI ignored the pain. The taste of everlasting life on my lips was too sweet for a mild annoyance. Mild, until it wasn\u2019t. The tightness crept into my arms, down my legs, rushed into my neck and consumed the inside of my mind.\n\nTrying to perceive the level of physical or mental anguish only worsens the other. Instinctually, I scream, but nothing comes out. Wailing blasts of silence erupt from my body as the will and ability to live leaves my body. The feeling of every bone slowly breaking and needles slowly pushing into each nerve, and yet I lie still as my soul sinks into the ground. And in this suffering, in these eternal seconds, I hear a soft voice utter\u2026\n\n\u201cunworthy\u201d", "ups": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.83}]
